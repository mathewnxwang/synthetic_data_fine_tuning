      "1. In late 2019, Away , a startup that sells luggage, had a problem. Weeks earlier, a handful of Away employees sent The Verge screenshots of Steph Korey, the company’s then 31-year-old founder and CEO, berating staff for, in her view, not working hard enough, not being devoted to Away’s customers enough, not living up to Away’s values enough, and, in one case where she questioned if some employees were “brain dead,” not being cognitively animated enough. After interviewing a number of former employees who described the messages as “consistent with a pattern of behavior from the company’s top leaders,” The Verge published a lengthy piece charging Korey with creating a “toxic work environment” inside of Away.\n",
      "2. Korey tweeted an apology , said she was “appalled and embarrassed” by her behavior, promised to better support her team through an awkward commitment to “work-life integration,” and, three days later, was fired. 1 Away replaced Korey with Stuart Haselden , a former Lululemon executive with over twenty years of retail experience. 2 Then Korey returned as CEO, saying the initial decision was a mistake and that The Verge story contained “deliberate lies and distortions.” 3\n",
      "3. Korey’s firing sparked a number of the tech industry’s long-standing cultural powder kegs. The real story was inequality : If Korey, who grew up in a 55,000 square foot home and was at one point worth $130 million , wanted her team to work harder, she should pay them more than $40,000 a year. The real story was about inexperienced management : Rather than yelling at her support team, Korey should’ve been focused on figuring out why Away was getting 4,000 customer service requests a day. The real story was Slack : Away’s reliance on always-on chat and Korey’s insistence that employees “have almost every conversation in public” enabled executives to surveil and intimidate staff. The real story was racism : Several people of color said that they were fired by Away because they made jokes about “ cis white men ” in a private Slack channel. The real story was sexism : Had Korey been a man, she would’ve been seen as decisive rather than tyrannical. 4 The real story was the media : The article was a hit piece—targeting both Away and Slack —uncovering nothing remarkable, written by a reporter with an ax to grind.\n",
      "4. It scissored Silicon Valley in half. 5 For a few weeks, no matter your team or tribe , you had an opinion on what happened at Away, and it proved that you had been right all along.\n",
      "5. The biggest nerve it touched, however, centered around the pressure that Korey, who was known for having a fanatical work ethic , put on her employees to work long hours, over weekends, and over holidays. Some argued that this expectation was abusive; others said it was necessary, the cost of doing business as a young company. 6\n",
      "6. This debate over work-life balance was not new; it’s a fault line that frequently shakes up Silicon Valley’s chattering class. Elon Musk regularly dislodges it by encouraging people to work 80 to 100 hours a week ; Basecamp founders Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson dislodged it when they published a book arguing that long hours are “a mark of stupidity;” every viral #DayInMyLife video from TikTok dislodges it . And Steph Korey inadvertently dislodged it by, among other things, preemptively rejecting her support team’s requests for time off in the name of accountability and empowerment.\n",
      "7. In this iteration, most of Korey's defenders didn't condone her approach—people couldn’t quite contort themselves into saying that calling her team braindead was reasonable. But many people, and especially venture capitalists and their social barnacles, defended her willingness to do whatever it takes to succeed. Rather than criticizing her managerial style, they said, we should applaud her “strong devotion” to her customers and her “meticulous care about the integrity of the product offered.” As one anonymous venture capitalist said , \"many VCs are reading it and recognizing the culture as the one they would love to see across their portfolio.”\n",
      "8. Fair enough; building a company is hard. Most companies won't succeed unless the people building them are obsessively devoted to that endeavor. 7\n",
      "9. But that’s where the story takes an odd twist: Away was, by any reasonable measure, already successful. By early 2018, Away was profitable . Korey’s personal stake in Away was likely worth tens of millions of dollars. Away’s flagship product received a “nearly flawless” score on Wired and was called the “perfect carry-on” by Vogue . They had a podcast , a magazine full of celebrities, and a Forbes cover .\n",
      "10. In other words, what was Korey still chasing? Why did Away need to raise another $100 million ? Why did it need 50 new stores and to build “a community” for people who bought suitcases? And why did she need to pursue those things with such relentless urgency that she forfeited her own managerial values—Korey had previously said that “you can’t be your most productive self if you’re not taking time to unplug,” and Away’s mission statement once said that “all time away is time well spent”—to do so?\n",
      "11. To people in tech, the answers to these questions are so self-evident that we barely recognize them as questions at all. She did it because that’s what you do when you start a company. If your company sells software, you build great software. If it sells luggage, suitcases—and “getting more out of every trip,” another part of Away’s mission—becomes your singular calling. You become passionate about resilient yet functionally minimal roller bags, or enterprise identity and access management , or solving payroll , or whatever. You go big, and then try to go bigger. In Silicon Valley, we’ve drowned ourselves so deeply in this ethos that we no longer realize that we’re in the water .\n",
      "12. In 2011, I was desperate, in a way that only a trophy-chasing twenty-four millennial can be desperate: My first job out of college, a junior analyst at a think tank in Washington, DC, was stalling, my grad school applications had been rejected, and I was running out of blue chip consulting firms, investment banks, and tech companies to apply to. Like so many other applicants for those positions, I didn’t know if I’d like doing these jobs; I only knew I’d like them on my resume. They weren’t passions, or even hobbies; they were the next opportunity for extrinsic validation . Thus far, the arc of my life—apply to college, go to college, apply for a vaguely prestigious job or smug fellowship, take the most notable one—had been mapped by others, and I figured I’d again drift towards my next “success.”\n",
      "13. I did not make it as far as I’d hoped. After a six-month job search, I landed my first offer on my fifty-ninth application: A data analyst at a San Francisco tech startup with a puzzling product, a clumsy name , and, as their MTV Cribs -themed recruiting video enthusiastically put it, “Cheetos, Fritos, and Doritios!” It wasn’t the glowing gold star that I was looking for, but with no alternative, I took the job.\n",
      "14. When I got to Silicon Valley in 2012, I was indistinguishable from many of the other new arrivals. We were young; we were educated; we were mostly white, mostly male, and mostly free of student debt. We preferred to wear jeans, drink IPAs, and talk about things—technology trends, SF housing policy, bourbon—as if we knew more about them than we did. Though it would take some time for me to be fully manufactured into a tech bro—for example, I still wore The North Face rather than Patagonia, SF’s preferred corporate athleisure—I was grade A raw material.\n",
      "15. I was also primed for indoctrination in a more important way: I was ambitious. Despite the Bay Area’s cultural and natural richness, I, like most people flooding into San Francisco’s central neighborhoods, didn’t come for those things. I came for my career. I came to succeed. I came to “have an impact.”  At what or on what, I didn’t know. But in a city overflowing with achievement, I assumed I’d figure it out.\n",
      "16. Within a few weeks of being in San Francisco, I hadn’t figured out what it meant to be successful in tech—I’d been run over by it. The three most common things I learned about my new coworkers were their name, their job title, and how early they joined the company. Days after I started, we celebrated raising nearly $100 million in funding—until, a few weeks later, Facebook bought Instagram , a company half our age and a fifth our size, for $1 billion. We lionized coworkers who left to join smaller companies or start their own; we wrote off coworkers who left for established giants like Google or Amazon, as if they were retiring. 8\n",
      "17. That was the only ruler by which we measured ourselves in San Francisco: How much money had your employer raised, how much hype did it have, and how early did you join? This singular scoreboard hung over everything—in every bar, at every Meetup™, inside every Yoga studio and CrossFit gym, on every date. In the tech bubble, there were no alternative measures of success, like there might be more professionally diverse cities. If you were to pick 20 random people out of a bar in New York or San Diego or Memphis, and ask them to sort themselves by social status, they’d probably disagree about the arrangement. How do you compare a dental hygienist to a teacher to a bike shop owner to an accountant? Why would you compare them at all?\n",
      "18. But ask 20 people at The Snug on Fillmore Street, and everyone would give the same answer. In fact, you don’t even need to ask—people who work in tech often arrange themselves by their professional strata on their own. In San Francisco, we are our jobs, we keep score, and we all know who’s winning. We have a scale, and we use it.\n",
      "19. The Bay Area isn’t entirely special in this regard; DC, for example, is also dominated by one industry, and full of young careerists who are hunting the same jobs. But Silicon Valley’s giant social scoreboard has one unique complication: The innate ambition of San Francisco’s startup class is also supercharged by the tech industry’s obsession with “growth.” We don’t value people by where they are. We value them in the same way we value our companies—by how fast they’re rising. Nobody talks about the CEO of a public company that’s growing at ten percent a year, or the Oracle SVP who’d been an SVP for a decade. We talked about the people and companies on the cusp —the rocket ships, the wunderkinds, the new new things .\n",
      "20. For better or for worse, in San Francisco, these vertical trajectories feel possible. Unlike other prestige professions, the tech industry celebrates those who skip to the front of the line. Startups have no entry level analyst program, no obligatory MBA hiatus, no rotational associate sequence, no residencies, no defined timelines for becoming a partner or managing director. In Silicon Valley, \"paying your dues\" is hearsay. Through the breathless profiles that fill Forbes, VC blogs , and countless 30 Under 30 lists, startup founders are regularly reminded about those who became rich and famous by refusing to be told they weren’t ready.\n",
      "21. And so, we all chase a definition of success that can only be measured by how much faster we were moving than our peers. Every step we take, every hour of work we put in, feels like an urgent acceleration towards… something. Fueled by our time and other people’s money, we race one another to the horizon.\n",
      "22. I have no idea if any of this mattered to Steph Korey. But there are a lot of parallels between her career and my own, and I know that they mattered to me . We both graduated from college the same year. We both worked at NGOs before moving to corporate jobs. Both of us started companies—Korey started Away and I started Mode, which built software for data analysts—in our mid- to late twenties.\n",
      "23. Moreover, both of us were opportunistic founders. According to one profile of Korey , she didn’t start Away because of any particular passion for luggage; she started it because her friend’s carry-on split open on an international flight. Despite initially being unsure if she wanted to start a business, Korey’s reluctance turned into cheeky ambition. “We weren’t interested in starting a small business,” she told Forbes , “we wanted to truly improve how people travel on a meaningful scale.”\n",
      "24. Similarly, prior to starting Mode, I had no interest in business intelligence software. I started it because two of my coworkers at Yammer built a popular internal tool , and they inexplicably offered me a seat at their founding table. But once in it, I was in it—trying to reinvent dashboards; writing countless blog posts about dashboards; being called, by the cruelest person on LinkedIn, a leader in the dashboarding space . 9\n",
      "25. In other words, Korey and I both stumbled into our respective businesses. Neither of us were building something that the world especially needed. And like so many founders and company leaders who get swept up in feverish ambitions and pace of startup life, we didn’t create businesses to manufacture products for customers; not really . We created them to manufacture accomplishment for ourselves. We just wanted to succeed; to win; to outclimb our peers.\n",
      "26. In tech, that’s not an ignoble cause. Sequoia Capital, a premier venture firm, believes that all of their investments should “have a desperate need to win.” In the wake of Kobe Bryant’s death, Marc Andreessen marked the occasion by reminding people that one of Kobe’s most admirable characteristics was his atomic obsession with winning. Others have explicitly drawn parallels between Kobe and successful founders for the same reason.\n",
      "27. I get why VCs say this stuff. It’s visceral; it’s provocative; it gets the people going. As a lifelong amateur athlete, my YouTube history is littered with Tiger fist pumps , kick-sixes , buzzer beaters and double bangs , 10 bat flips , home run mics , Nike and Under Armour ads, and Minneapolis Miracle remixes . Without a court to compete on, startups became our arena. And we become as monomaniacal about winning our game as athletes and coaches are about winning theirs.\n",
      "28. There is nothing inherently wrong with that. People need competition; they need meaning; we cannot just gaze into the abyss of our fleeting existence on a lonely mote of dust floating through an eternal void. We all have religions because we all need religions. If someone finds purpose in building Instagramable totes, that is no more or less cosmically relevant than anything else. And on a more planetary scale, it’s probably not a bad thing for some people to be entrepreneurs for the love of the game —or even, just for the trophies . Suitcases may not be metaphysically material, but a nice one does make flying a little less of a headache . 11\n",
      "29. Instead, what I think is important to recognize about our motivations is not that they are bad; it is that they are circumstantial . Thousands of people in Silicon Valley meander into their ambitions, via pivots , via pranks , or—as seemed to happen for me and Korey—via professional serendipity. But just as we can wander into our life’s calling, we can wander out.\n",
      "30. There is one more parallel between my career and Steph Korey’s: We both got fired from our startups. ThoughtSpot, which acquired Mode almost exactly a year ago, let me go two months ago.\n",
      "31. So it goes; such is the circle of life in Silicon Valley. If you don’t like that deal, don’t work here. Still, the moment was striking to me, not in what it was, but in what it was not. For years, you don’t just work somewhere; you are consumed by it. The things that matter to you are the things that matter to it. For better or for worse, it puts blinders on your ambitions: You obsess over success in your field, and wonder why people in other fields stress about the trivial status games in theirs. 12\n",
      "32. And then…you don’t. Your calendar is cleared; your to-do list is zeroed; your problems are suddenly someone else's responsibility. You're pulled from the water that you long ago forgot was water, and dropped directly onto the land.\n",
      "33. Standing on the shore, your old pond—the pond where you did your life's work, in which nothing seemed more important than being a big fish—suddenly looks like all the other ponds you used to care so little about. It looks distant ; foreign; trivial. From that vantage point, you don't mourn leaving it; you mourn having spent so much time there.\n",
      "34. That doesn't mean it didn’t matter. It simply means that our ambitions are defined by our environment. On short time scales, this is obvious; in the moments that we desperately crave tacos , or a quiet moment to ourselves, or a cold shower, we know that we won’t want them forever. In a couple hours, we’ll be full and repulsed by food ; in a couple days, we'll want to pop out with some friends ; in a couple months, we’ll want a hot shower and cozy blanket.\n",
      "35. The same is true over longer time scales; it’s just harder to see. When you’ve been on a ten-year trek looking for a taco, you forget that you might one day want something else.\n",
      "36. This has a corollary that is even harder to see, and harder still to act on. You can manufacture ambition . Being a suitcase executive, building data software, chasing status in Silicon Valley—these are not innate in us. We care about these things because we submerged ourselves in them, became acclimated to it, and forgot that it was water.\n",
      "37. But there are other ponds that we could lose ourselves in. If you start going to pottery classes, suddenly pottery will be your thing. If you become a barista, a guy on YouTube might become your idol. If you work in sports media, you’ll find yourself caring about this gossip and not that gossip . We think that we surround ourselves with our interests, but causality often runs the other way: We become interested in what we’re surrounded by.\n",
      "38. We can choose that context—it just takes a leap of faith. As long as your environment stays the same, so will your ambitions. You’ll value the same things as you did yesterday, care about the opinions of the same people, and chase the same trophies. If you change this context, these things will change too. But that’s the uncomfortable order it has to happen: You won’t want something new until you walk away from the thing you currently want.\n",
      "39. That’s the real trap of Silicon Valley, and of other prestige industries. For aimless high-achievers—for people whose only honest answer to the question of “what do you want to be when you grow up?” is “successful”—they offer a default scale. And then, its scale becomes our scale. Though we start out working there despite the job being about shifting paradigms across scalable B2B SaaS, we eventually work there because the job is about shifting paradigms across scalable B2B SaaS. That’s the real punchline to this joke : If you work in tech long enough, this might actually become what you love.\n",
      "40. And maybe that’s ok. But at a minimum, we shouldn’t find our ambitions by accident .  If we imagine that we’re no longer in our current pond—that we got fired, or are 16 years old and dreaming about what we to do with our life, or 80 years old and reflecting on what we did—what would we care about then? Are the ladders we spent our time climbing the ladders that we really want to stand at the top of?\n",
      "41. Whatever we imagine that existential ambition will be then, we we can make it our day-to-day ambition now, but not without sacrificing our current idols. Because there will be a moment when all have to ask ourselves if we got what we wanted from this life , and the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing us he'd come for us after we die, and not when we're still living .\n",
      "42. All of her tweets, including her apology, have since been deleted.\n",
      "43. Away initially said that the change had been in the works for months. This was later reported to be partially true. Haselden had been planning on joining before The Verge story, but as COO, not CEO.\n",
      "44. Nine months later, in October of 2020, Korey stepped down again .\n",
      "45. On one hand, the tech industry definitely idolizes men—Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Larry Ellison, Andy Grove, Travis Kalanick, many more—when they are notoriously demanding. On the other hand, maybe we shouldn’t? To assume that they were great because they were jerks is like assuming John McEnroe was great because he threw tantrums. I get that greatness can often be prickly, and you can’t throw out the outbursts without potentially losing the passion. But we don’t need to celebrate or mimic that behavior; we can aspire to be more decent. For every Steve Jobs, there are thousands of us with less talent whose tempers don’t make us great leaders; they just make us cruel.\n",
      "46. Away is neither a tech company nor located in Silicon Valley . However, the Silicon Valley metonym has grown to include venture-backed startups in other major U.S. cities like New York, Boston, Austin, and, for a minute , Miami. Silicon Valley isn’t a place; it’s a mentality .\n",
      "47. On “work-life balance,” some people take jobs to get rich, because they’re compulsively ambitious, and because they’re hypnotized by the thrill of explosive growth. Some people take jobs to work on interesting problems, to work with supportive teams, and simply to make enough money to have lives outside of their offices.\n",
      "48. A lot of startups try to have it both ways. They try to offer rides on a rocketship while also putting people and culture first. And when the two are at odds, they gaslight employees by camouflaging oppressive hours as “wild and exciting and unexpected and beautiful.” Other industries like finance are at least direct about what they offer: They pay you a lot of money to steamroll you with work. It may be abusive, but it’s transparent.\n",
      "49. That’s why I think startups should be more explicit about how they make these tradeoffs. It’s fine to chase growth at all costs, to build a company and culture that prioritizes the lifestyle of its employees first, or to do something in the middle. But everyone needs to know which temple they’re in.\n",
      "50. Also—a lot of people seem to see this as a choice between winning and gently losing. But this misses the point. We don’t have to define winning around money or market dominance. We can also define it through how much we enjoy the responsibilities that fill our days, or how we support the lives of those we employ. We can still be competitive; we can still have a desperate need to win; we can still refuse to process failure . We just have to be independently-minded enough to not let others define what winning and losing means.\n",
      "51. Similarly, VCs’ livelihoods—or at least their statuses, their Twitter audiences, their invites to the All-In Summit, and their futures as authors of pop management books with glowing introductions from authors of other pop management books—depend on their portfolios surviving.\n",
      "52. Later that year, Microsoft “retired” us all by buying Yammer. We scoffed at their offices, their stale software products, and their bureaucratic performance management practices. We quit, sold our Microsoft shares, and started companies that would build things, and not just tell stories about the glory days .\n",
      "53. Most of those companies are out of business. Microsoft’s shares are up 1,500 percent, and it is now the most valuable company in the world. Ah well.\n",
      "54. I mean, oh man, does a message like this make you question your life choices.\n",
      "55. It’s funny now, because they’re the same team .\n",
      "56. That said, this can also cause problems. In 1838, Abraham Lincoln said this about ambition :\n",
      "57. It sees no distinction in adding story to story, upon the monuments of fame, erected to the memory of others. It denies that it is glory enough to serve under any chief. It scorns to tread in the footsteps of any predecessor, however illustrious.\n",
      "58. No doubt, society benefits from some degree of gamified entrepreneurship. But there can be a point at which that goes too far, and rather than working together, every great creator wants their own solo career.\n",
      "59. For example, there are legions of Zoomers who are obsessed with their social standing on Instagram and TikTok. Do you care about what these people think? Does their game matter ? If that totem pole isn’t important, isn’t it possible to imagine that one day yours may not be either?\n"

      "Parsed post content from https://benn.substack.com/p/ambition-then-and-now successfully: ['In late 2019, Away , a startup that sells luggage, had a problem. Weeks earlier, a handful of Away employees sent The Verge screenshots of Steph Korey, the company’s then 31-year-old founder and CEO, berating staff for, in her view, not working hard enough, not being devoted to Away’s customers enough, not living up to Away’s values enough, and, in one case where she questioned if some employees were “brain dead,” not being cognitively animated enough. After interviewing a number of former employees who described the messages as “consistent with a pattern of behavior from the company’s top leaders,” The Verge published a lengthy piece charging Korey with creating a “toxic work environment” inside of Away.', 'Korey tweeted an apology , said she was “appalled and embarrassed” by her behavior, promised to better support her team through an awkward commitment to “work-life integration,” and, three days later, was fired. 1 Away replaced Korey with Stuart Haselden , a former Lululemon executive with over twenty years of retail experience. 2 Then Korey returned as CEO, saying the initial decision was a mistake and that The Verge story contained “deliberate lies and distortions.” 3', 'Korey’s firing sparked a number of the tech industry’s long-standing cultural powder kegs. The real story was inequality : If Korey, who grew up in a 55,000 square foot home and was at one point worth $130 million , wanted her team to work harder, she should pay them more than $40,000 a year. The real story was about inexperienced management : Rather than yelling at her support team, Korey should’ve been focused on figuring out why Away was getting 4,000 customer service requests a day. The real story was Slack : Away’s reliance on always-on chat and Korey’s insistence that employees “have almost every conversation in public” enabled executives to surveil and intimidate staff. The real story was racism : Several people of color said that they were fired by Away because they made jokes about “ cis white men ” in a private Slack channel. The real story was sexism : Had Korey been a man, she would’ve been seen as decisive rather than tyrannical. 4 The real story was the media : The article was a hit piece—targeting both Away and Slack —uncovering nothing remarkable, written by a reporter with an ax to grind.', 'It scissored Silicon Valley in half. 5 For a few weeks, no matter your team or tribe , you had an opinion on what happened at Away, and it proved that you had been right all along.', 'The biggest nerve it touched, however, centered around the pressure that Korey, who was known for having a fanatical work ethic , put on her employees to work long hours, over weekends, and over holidays. Some argued that this expectation was abusive; others said it was necessary, the cost of doing business as a young company. 6', 'This debate over work-life balance was not new; it’s a fault line that frequently shakes up Silicon Valley’s chattering class. Elon Musk regularly dislodges it by encouraging people to work 80 to 100 hours a week ; Basecamp founders Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson dislodged it when they published a book arguing that long hours are “a mark of stupidity;” every viral #DayInMyLife video from TikTok dislodges it . And Steph Korey inadvertently dislodged it by, among other things, preemptively rejecting her support team’s requests for time off in the name of accountability and empowerment.', 'In this iteration, most of Korey\\'s defenders didn\\'t condone her approach—people couldn’t quite contort themselves into saying that calling her team braindead was reasonable. But many people, and especially venture capitalists and their social barnacles, defended her willingness to do whatever it takes to succeed. Rather than criticizing her managerial style, they said, we should applaud her “strong devotion” to her customers and her “meticulous care about the integrity of the product offered.” As one anonymous venture capitalist said , \"many VCs are reading it and recognizing the culture as the one they would love to see across their portfolio.”', \"Fair enough; building a company is hard. Most companies won't succeed unless the people building them are obsessively devoted to that endeavor. 7\", 'But that’s where the story takes an odd twist: Away was, by any reasonable measure, already successful. By early 2018, Away was profitable . Korey’s personal stake in Away was likely worth tens of millions of dollars. Away’s flagship product received a “nearly flawless” score on Wired and was called the “perfect carry-on” by Vogue . They had a podcast , a magazine full of celebrities, and a Forbes cover .', 'In other words, what was Korey still chasing? Why did Away need to raise another $100 million ? Why did it need 50 new stores and to build “a community” for people who bought suitcases? And why did she need to pursue those things with such relentless urgency that she forfeited her own managerial values—Korey had previously said that “you can’t be your most productive self if you’re not taking time to unplug,” and Away’s mission statement once said that “all time away is time well spent”—to do so?', 'To people in tech, the answers to these questions are so self-evident that we barely recognize them as questions at all. She did it because that’s what you do when you start a company. If your company sells software, you build great software. If it sells luggage, suitcases—and “getting more out of every trip,” another part of Away’s mission—becomes your singular calling. You become passionate about resilient yet functionally minimal roller bags, or enterprise identity and access management , or solving payroll , or whatever. You go big, and then try to go bigger. In Silicon Valley, we’ve drowned ourselves so deeply in this ethos that we no longer realize that we’re in the water .', 'In 2011, I was desperate, in a way that only a trophy-chasing twenty-four millennial can be desperate: My first job out of college, a junior analyst at a think tank in Washington, DC, was stalling, my grad school applications had been rejected, and I was running out of blue chip consulting firms, investment banks, and tech companies to apply to. Like so many other applicants for those positions, I didn’t know if I’d like doing these jobs; I only knew I’d like them on my resume. They weren’t passions, or even hobbies; they were the next opportunity for extrinsic validation . Thus far, the arc of my life—apply to college, go to college, apply for a vaguely prestigious job or smug fellowship, take the most notable one—had been mapped by others, and I figured I’d again drift towards my next “success.”', 'I did not make it as far as I’d hoped. After a six-month job search, I landed my first offer on my fifty-ninth application: A data analyst at a San Francisco tech startup with a puzzling product, a clumsy name , and, as their MTV Cribs -themed recruiting video enthusiastically put it, “Cheetos, Fritos, and Doritios!” It wasn’t the glowing gold star that I was looking for, but with no alternative, I took the job.', 'When I got to Silicon Valley in 2012, I was indistinguishable from many of the other new arrivals. We were young; we were educated; we were mostly white, mostly male, and mostly free of student debt. We preferred to wear jeans, drink IPAs, and talk about things—technology trends, SF housing policy, bourbon—as if we knew more about them than we did. Though it would take some time for me to be fully manufactured into a tech bro—for example, I still wore The North Face rather than Patagonia, SF’s preferred corporate athleisure—I was grade A raw material.', 'I was also primed for indoctrination in a more important way: I was ambitious. Despite the Bay Area’s cultural and natural richness, I, like most people flooding into San Francisco’s central neighborhoods, didn’t come for those things. I came for my career. I came to succeed. I came to “have an impact.”\\xa0 At what or on what, I didn’t know. But in a city overflowing with achievement, I assumed I’d figure it out.', 'Within a few weeks of being in San Francisco, I hadn’t figured out what it meant to be successful in tech—I’d been run over by it. The three most common things I learned about my new coworkers were their name, their job title, and how early they joined the company. Days after I started, we celebrated raising nearly $100 million in funding—until, a few weeks later, Facebook bought Instagram , a company half our age and a fifth our size, for $1 billion. We lionized coworkers who left to join smaller companies or start their own; we wrote off coworkers who left for established giants like Google or Amazon, as if they were retiring. 8', 'That was the only ruler by which we measured ourselves in San Francisco: How much money had your employer raised, how much hype did it have, and how early did you join? This singular scoreboard hung over everything—in every bar, at every Meetup™, inside every Yoga studio and CrossFit gym, on every date. In the tech bubble, there were no alternative measures of success, like there might be more professionally diverse cities. If you were to pick 20 random people out of a bar in New York or San Diego or Memphis, and ask them to sort themselves by social status, they’d probably disagree about the arrangement. How do you compare a dental hygienist to a teacher to a bike shop owner to an accountant? Why would you compare them at all?', 'But ask 20 people at The Snug on Fillmore Street, and everyone would give the same answer. In fact, you don’t even need to ask—people who work in tech often arrange themselves by their professional strata on their own. In San Francisco, we are our jobs, we keep score, and we all know who’s winning. We have a scale, and we use it.', 'The Bay Area isn’t entirely special in this regard; DC, for example, is also dominated by one industry, and full of young careerists who are hunting the same jobs. But Silicon Valley’s giant social scoreboard has one unique complication: The innate ambition of San Francisco’s startup class is also supercharged by the tech industry’s obsession with “growth.” We don’t value people by where they are. We value them in the same way we value our companies—by how fast they’re rising. Nobody talks about the CEO of a public company that’s growing at ten percent a year, or the Oracle SVP who’d been an SVP for a decade. We talked about the people and companies on the cusp —the rocket ships, the wunderkinds, the new new things .', 'For better or for worse, in San Francisco, these vertical trajectories feel possible. Unlike other prestige professions, the tech industry celebrates those who skip to the front of the line. Startups have no entry level analyst program, no obligatory MBA hiatus, no rotational associate sequence, no residencies, no defined timelines for becoming a partner or managing director. In Silicon Valley, \"paying your dues\" is hearsay. Through the breathless profiles that fill Forbes, VC blogs , and countless 30 Under 30 lists, startup founders are regularly reminded about those who became rich and famous by refusing to be told they weren’t ready.', 'And so, we all chase a definition of success that can only be measured by how much faster we were moving than our peers. Every step we take, every hour of work we put in, feels like an urgent acceleration towards… something. Fueled by our time and other people’s money, we race one another to the horizon.', 'I have no idea if any of this mattered to Steph Korey. But there are a lot of parallels between her career and my own, and I know that they mattered to me . We both graduated from college the same year. We both worked at NGOs before moving to corporate jobs. Both of us started companies—Korey started Away and I started Mode, which built software for data analysts—in our mid- to late twenties.', 'Moreover, both of us were opportunistic founders. According to one profile of Korey , she didn’t start Away because of any particular passion for luggage; she started it because her friend’s carry-on split open on an international flight. Despite initially being unsure if she wanted to start a business, Korey’s reluctance turned into cheeky ambition. “We weren’t interested in starting a small business,” she told Forbes , “we wanted to truly improve how people travel on a meaningful scale.”', 'Similarly, prior to starting Mode, I had no interest in business intelligence software. I started it because two of my coworkers at Yammer built a popular internal tool , and they inexplicably offered me a seat at their founding table.

Neither of us were building something that the world especially needed. And like so many founders and company leaders who get swept up in feverish ambitions and pace of startup life, we didn’t create businesses to manufacture products for customers; not really . We created them to manufacture accomplishment for ourselves. We just wanted to succeed; to win; to outclimb our peers.', 'In tech, that’s not an ignoble cause.

And we become as monomaniacal about winning our game as athletes and coaches are about winning theirs.', 'There is nothing inherently wrong with that.

Still, the moment was striking to me, not in what it was, but in what it was not. For years, you don’t just work somewhere; you are consumed by it. The things that matter to you are the things that matter to it. For better or for worse, it puts blinders on your ambitions: You obsess over success in your field, and wonder why people in other fields stress about the trivial status games in theirs. 12', \"And then…you don’t. Your calendar is cleared; your to-do list is zeroed; your problems are suddenly someone else's responsibility.

It looks distant ; foreign; trivial. From that vantage point, you don't mourn leaving it; you mourn having spent so much time there.\", \"That doesn't mean it didn’t matter. It simply means that our ambitions are defined by our environment. On short time scales, this is obvious; in the moments that we desperately crave tacos , or a quiet moment to ourselves, or a cold shower, we know that we won’t want them forever. In a couple hours, we’ll be full and repulsed by food ; in a couple days, we'll want to pop out with some friends ; in a couple months, we’ll want a hot shower and cozy blanket.\", 'The same is true over longer time scales; it’s just harder to see. When you’ve been on a ten-year trek looking for a taco, you forget that you might one day want something else.', 'This has a corollary that is even harder to see, and harder still to act on. You can manufacture ambition . Being a suitcase executive, building data software, chasing status in Silicon Valley—these are not innate in us. We care about these things because we submerged ourselves in them, became acclimated to it, and forgot that it was water.', 'But there are other ponds that we could lose ourselves in. If you start going to pottery classes, suddenly pottery will be your thing. If you become a barista, a guy on YouTube might become your idol. If you work in sports media, you’ll find yourself caring about this gossip and not that gossip . We think that we surround ourselves with our interests, but causality often runs the other way: We become interested in what we’re surrounded by.', 'We can choose that context—it just takes a leap of faith. As long as your environment stays the same, so will your ambitions. You’ll value the same things as you did yesterday, care about the opinions of the same people, and chase the same trophies. If you change this context, these things will change too. But that’s the uncomfortable order it has to happen: You won’t want something new until you walk away from the thing you currently want.', 'That’s the real trap of Silicon Valley, and of other prestige industries. For aimless high-achievers—for people whose only honest answer to the question of “what do you want to be when you grow up?” is “successful”—they offer a default scale. And then, its scale becomes our scale. Though we start out working there despite the job being about shifting paradigms across scalable B2B SaaS, we eventually work there because the job is about shifting paradigms across scalable B2B SaaS. That’s the real punchline to this joke : If you work in tech long enough, this might actually become what you love.', 'And maybe that’s ok.

On the other hand, maybe we shouldn’t? To assume that they were great because they were jerks is like assuming John McEnroe was great because he threw tantrums. I get that greatness can often be prickly, and you can’t throw out the outbursts without potentially losing the passion. But we don’t need to celebrate or mimic that behavior; we can aspire to be more decent. For every Steve Jobs, there are thousands of us with less talent whose tempers don’t make us great leaders; they just make us cruel.', 'Away is neither a tech company nor located in Silicon Valley . However, the Silicon Valley metonym has grown to include venture-backed startups in other major U.S. cities like New York, Boston, Austin, and, for a minute , Miami. Silicon Valley isn’t a place; it’s a mentality .', 'On “work-life balance,” some people take jobs to get rich, because they’re compulsively ambitious, and because they’re hypnotized by the thrill of explosive growth. Some people take jobs to work on interesting problems, to work with supportive teams, and simply to make enough money to have lives outside of their offices.', 'A lot of startups try to have it both ways. They try to offer rides on a rocketship while also putting people and culture first. And when the two are at odds, they gaslight employees by camouflaging oppressive hours as “wild and exciting and unexpected and beautiful.” Other industries like finance are at least direct about what they offer: They pay you a lot of money to steamroll you with work. It may be abusive, but it’s transparent.', 'That’s why I think startups should be more explicit about how they make these tradeoffs. It’s fine to chase growth at all costs, to build a company and culture that prioritizes the lifestyle of its employees first, or to do something in the middle. But everyone needs to know which temple they’re in.', 'Also—a lot of people seem to see this as a choice between winning and gently losing. But this misses the point. We don’t have to define winning around money or market dominance. We can also define it through how much we enjoy the responsibilities that fill our days, or how we support the lives of those we employ. We can still be competitive; we can still have a desperate need to win; we can still refuse to process failure . We just have to be independently-minded enough to not let others define what winning and losing means.', 'Similarly, VCs’ livelihoods—or at least their statuses, their Twitter audiences, their invites to the All-In Summit, and their futures as authors of pop management books with glowing introductions from authors of other pop management books—depend on their portfolios surviving.', 'Later that year, Microsoft “retired” us all by buying Yammer. We scoffed at their offices, their stale software products, and their bureaucratic performance management practices. We quit, sold our Microsoft shares, and started companies that would build things, and not just tell stories about the glory days .', 'Most of those companies are out of business. Microsoft’s shares are up 1,500 percent, and it is now the most valuable company in the world. Ah well.', 'I mean, oh man, does a message like this make you question your life choices.', 'It’s funny now, because they’re the same team .', 'That said, this can also cause problems.

It scorns to tread in the footsteps of any predecessor, however illustrious.', 'No doubt, society benefits from some degree of gamified entrepreneurship. But there can be a point at which that goes too far, and rather than working together, every great creator wants their own solo career.', 'For example, there are legions of Zoomers who are obsessed with their social standing on Instagram and TikTok.

      "Chunked content successfully: ['In late 2019, Away , a startup that sells luggage, had a problem. Weeks earlier, a handful of Away employees sent The Verge screenshots of Steph Korey, the company’s then 31-year-old founder and CEO, berating staff for, in her view, not working hard enough, not being devoted to Away’s customers enough, not living up to Away’s values enough, and, in one case where she questioned if some employees were “brain dead,” not being cognitively animated enough. After interviewing a number of former employees who described the messages as “consistent with a pattern of behavior from the company’s top leaders,” The Verge published a lengthy piece charging Korey with creating a “toxic work environment” inside of Away.Korey tweeted an apology , said she was “appalled and embarrassed” by her behavior, promised to better support her team through an awkward commitment to “work-life integration,” and, three days later, was fired. 1 Away replaced Korey with Stuart Haselden , a former Lululemon executive with over twenty years of retail experience. 2 Then Korey returned as CEO, saying the initial decision was a mistake and that The Verge story contained “deliberate lies and distortions.” 3Korey’s firing sparked a number of the tech industry’s long-standing cultural powder kegs. The real story was inequality : If Korey, who grew up in a 55,000 square foot home and was at one point worth $130 million , wanted her team to work harder, she should pay them more than $40,000 a year. The real story was about inexperienced management : Rather than yelling at her support team, Korey should’ve been focused on figuring out why Away was getting 4,000 customer service requests a day. The real story was Slack : Away’s reliance on always-on chat and Korey’s insistence that employees “have almost every conversation in public” enabled executives to surveil and intimidate staff. The real story was racism : Several people of color said that they were fired by Away because they made jokes about “ cis white men ” in a private Slack channel. The real story was sexism : Had Korey been a man, she would’ve been seen as decisive rather than tyrannical. 4 The real story was the media : The article was a hit piece—targeting both Away and Slack —uncovering nothing remarkable, written by a reporter with an ax to grind.', 'Korey’s firing sparked a number of the tech industry’s long-standing cultural powder kegs.

Some argued that this expectation was abusive; others said it was necessary, the cost of doing business as a young company. 6', 'The biggest nerve it touched, however, centered around the pressure that Korey, who was known for having a fanatical work ethic , put on her employees to work long hours, over weekends, and over holidays. Some argued that this expectation was abusive; others said it was necessary, the cost of doing business as a young company. 6This debate over work-life balance was not new; it’s a fault line that frequently shakes up Silicon Valley’s chattering class. Elon Musk regularly dislodges it by encouraging people to work 80 to 100 hours a week ; Basecamp founders Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson dislodged it when they published a book arguing that long hours are “a mark of stupidity;” every viral #DayInMyLife video from TikTok dislodges it . And Steph Korey inadvertently dislodged it by, among other things, preemptively rejecting her support team’s requests for time off in the name of accountability and empowerment.In this iteration, most of Korey\\'s defenders didn\\'t condone her approach—people couldn’t quite contort themselves into saying that calling her team braindead was reasonable. But many people, and especially venture capitalists and their social barnacles, defended her willingness to do whatever it takes to succeed. Rather than criticizing her managerial style, they said, we should applaud her “strong devotion” to her customers and her “meticulous care about the integrity of the product offered.” As one anonymous venture capitalist said , \"many VCs are reading it and recognizing the culture as the one they would love to see across their portfolio.”', 'In this iteration, most of Korey\\'s defenders didn\\'t condone her approach—people couldn’t quite contort themselves into saying that calling her team braindead was reasonable.

Most companies won\\'t succeed unless the people building them are obsessively devoted to that endeavor. 7But that’s where the story takes an odd twist: Away was, by any reasonable measure, already successful. By early 2018, Away was profitable . Korey’s personal stake in Away was likely worth tens of millions of dollars. Away’s flagship product received a “nearly flawless” score on Wired and was called the “perfect carry-on” by Vogue .

Why did it need 50 new stores and to build “a community” for people who bought suitcases? And why did she need to pursue those things with such relentless urgency that she forfeited her own managerial values—Korey had previously said that “you can’t be your most productive self if you’re not taking time to unplug,” and Away’s mission statement once said that “all time away is time well spent”—to do so?To people in tech, the answers to these questions are so self-evident that we barely recognize them as questions at all. She did it because that’s what you do when you start a company. If your company sells software, you build great software. If it sells luggage, suitcases—and “getting more out of every trip,” another part of Away’s mission—becomes your singular calling. You become passionate about resilient yet functionally minimal roller bags, or enterprise identity and access management , or solving payroll , or whatever. You go big, and then try to go bigger.

In Silicon Valley, we’ve drowned ourselves so deeply in this ethos that we no longer realize that we’re in the water .In 2011, I was desperate, in a way that only a trophy-chasing twenty-four millennial can be desperate: My first job out of college, a junior analyst at a think tank in Washington, DC, was stalling, my grad school applications had been rejected, and I was running out of blue chip consulting firms, investment banks, and tech companies to apply to. Like so many other applicants for those positions, I didn’t know if I’d like doing these jobs; I only knew I’d like them on my resume. They weren’t passions, or even hobbies; they were the next opportunity for extrinsic validation . Thus far, the arc of my life—apply to college, go to college, apply for a vaguely prestigious job or smug fellowship, take the most notable one—had been mapped by others, and I figured I’d again drift towards my next “success.”I did not make it as far as I’d hoped. After a six-month job search, I landed my first offer on my fifty-ninth application: A data analyst at a San Francisco tech startup with a puzzling product, a clumsy name , and, as their MTV Cribs -themed recruiting video enthusiastically put it, “Cheetos, Fritos, and Doritios!” It wasn’t the glowing gold star that I was looking for, but with no alternative, I took the job.', 'I did not make it as far as I’d hoped.

We were young; we were educated; we were mostly white, mostly male, and mostly free of student debt. We preferred to wear jeans, drink IPAs, and talk about things—technology trends, SF housing policy, bourbon—as if we knew more about them than we did. Though it would take some time for me to be fully manufactured into a tech bro—for example, I still wore The North Face rather than Patagonia, SF’s preferred corporate athleisure—I was grade A raw material.I was also primed for indoctrination in a more important way: I was ambitious. Despite the Bay Area’s cultural and natural richness, I, like most people flooding into San Francisco’s central neighborhoods, didn’t come for those things. I came for my career. I came to succeed. I came to “have an impact.”\\xa0 At what or on what, I didn’t know.

But in a city overflowing with achievement, I assumed I’d figure it out.Within a few weeks of being in San Francisco, I hadn’t figured out what it meant to be successful in tech—I’d been run over by it. The three most common things I learned about my new coworkers were their name, their job title, and how early they joined the company. Days after I started, we celebrated raising nearly $100 million in funding—until, a few weeks later, Facebook bought Instagram , a company half our age and a fifth our size, for $1 billion. We lionized coworkers who left to join smaller companies or start their own; we wrote off coworkers who left for established giants like Google or Amazon, as if they were retiring. 8That was the only ruler by which we measured ourselves in San Francisco: How much money had your employer raised, how much hype did it have, and how early did you join? This singular scoreboard hung over everything—in every bar, at every Meetup™, inside every Yoga studio and CrossFit gym, on every date. In the tech bubble, there were no alternative measures of success, like there might be more professionally diverse cities. If you were to pick 20 random people out of a bar in New York or San Diego or Memphis, and ask them to sort themselves by social status, they’d probably disagree about the arrangement. How do you compare a dental hygienist to a teacher to a bike shop owner to an accountant? Why would you compare them at all?', 'That was the only ruler by which we measured ourselves in San Francisco: How much money had your employer raised, how much hype did it have, and how early did you join?

In San Francisco, we are our jobs, we keep score, and we all know who’s winning. We have a scale, and we use it.The Bay Area isn’t entirely special in this regard; DC, for example, is also dominated by one industry, and full of young careerists who are hunting the same jobs. But Silicon Valley’s giant social scoreboard has one unique complication: The innate ambition of San Francisco’s startup class is also supercharged by the tech industry’s obsession with “growth.” We don’t value people by where they are. We value them in the same way we value our companies—by how fast they’re rising. Nobody talks about the CEO of a public company that’s growing at ten percent a year, or the Oracle SVP who’d been an SVP for a decade. We talked about the people and companies on the cusp —the rocket ships, the wunderkinds, the new new things .', 'The Bay Area isn’t entirely special in this regard; DC, for example, is also dominated by one industry, and full of young careerists who are hunting the same jobs.

Unlike other prestige professions, the tech industry celebrates those who skip to the front of the line. Startups have no entry level analyst program, no obligatory MBA hiatus, no rotational associate sequence, no residencies, no defined timelines for becoming a partner or managing director. In Silicon Valley, \"paying your dues\" is hearsay. Through the breathless profiles that fill Forbes, VC blogs , and countless 30 Under 30 lists, startup founders are regularly reminded about those who became rich and famous by refusing to be told they weren’t ready.And so, we all chase a definition of success that can only be measured by how much faster we were moving than our peers. Every step we take, every hour of work we put in, feels like an urgent acceleration towards… something.

We both worked at NGOs before moving to corporate jobs. Both of us started companies—Korey started Away and I started Mode, which built software for data analysts—in our mid- to late twenties.Moreover, both of us were opportunistic founders. According to one profile of Korey , she didn’t start Away because of any particular passion for luggage; she started it because her friend’s carry-on split open on an international flight.

It simply means that our ambitions are defined by our environment.

In a couple hours, we’ll be full and repulsed by food ; in a couple days, we'll want to pop out with some friends ; in a couple months, we’ll want a hot shower and cozy blanket.The same is true over longer time scales; it’s just harder to see.

You can manufacture ambition . Being a suitcase executive, building data software, chasing status in Silicon Valley—these are not innate in us. We care about these things because we submerged ourselves in them, became acclimated to it, and forgot that it was water.But there are other ponds that we could lose ourselves in. If you start going to pottery classes, suddenly pottery will be your thing. If you become a barista, a guy on YouTube might become your idol.

However, the Silicon Valley metonym has grown to include venture-backed startups in other major U.S. cities like New York, Boston, Austin, and, for a minute , Miami. Silicon Valley isn’t a place; it’s a mentality .On “work-life balance,” some people take jobs to get rich, because they’re compulsively ambitious, and because they’re hypnotized by the thrill of explosive growth. Some people take jobs to work on interesting problems, to work with supportive teams, and simply to make enough money to have lives outside of their offices.', 'On “work-life balance,” some people take jobs to get rich, because they’re compulsively ambitious, and because they’re hypnotized by the thrill of explosive growth. Some people take jobs to work on interesting problems, to work with supportive teams, and simply to make enough money to have lives outside of their offices.A lot of startups try to have it both ways. They try to offer rides on a rocketship while also putting people and culture first. And when the two are at odds, they gaslight employees by camouflaging oppressive hours as “wild and exciting and unexpected and beautiful.” Other industries like finance are at least direct about what they offer: They pay you a lot of money to steamroll you with work. It may be abusive, but it’s transparent.That’s why I think startups should be more explicit about how they make these tradeoffs. It’s fine to chase growth at all costs, to build a company and culture that prioritizes the lifestyle of its employees first, or to do something in the middle. But everyone needs to know which temple they’re in.', 'That’s why I think startups should be more explicit about how they make these tradeoffs.

We don’t have to define winning around money or market dominance. We can also define it through how much we enjoy the responsibilities that fill our days, or how we support the lives of those we employ. We can still be competitive; we can still have a desperate need to win; we can still refuse to process failure . We just have to be independently-minded enough to not let others define what winning and losing means.Similarly, VCs’ livelihoods—or at least their statuses, their Twitter audiences, their invites to the All-In Summit, and their futures as authors of pop management books with glowing introductions from authors of other pop management books—depend on their portfolios surviving.', 'Similarly, VCs’ livelihoods—or at least their statuses, their Twitter audiences, their invites to the All-In Summit, and their futures as authors of pop management books with glowing introductions from authors of other pop management books—depend on their portfolios surviving.Later that year, Microsoft “retired” us all by buying Yammer.

In 1838, Abraham Lincoln said this about ambition :It sees no distinction in adding story to story, upon the monuments of fame, erected to the memory of others. It denies that it is glory enough to serve under any chief.

But there can be a point at which that goes too far, and rather than working together, every great creator wants their own solo career.For example, there are legions of Zoomers who are obsessed with their social standing on Instagram and TikTok.

Instead, everything feels planned and scheduled; every interaction is something between politely professional and suspiciously enthusiastic; every message is awkwardly formatted to be maximally viral.

What’s even weirder, however, is how isolated LinkedIn is. It’s a vault, locked on both sides.

      "Conversation response: I can’t help but wonder if that’s also part of the attraction of LinkedIn: It’s a social network where we can all feel popular, even in our khakis and corporate drawl. It’s a perpetual online work trip, where everyone feels professionally obligated to act like friends. Over the last twenty years, we’ve all become addicted to our jobs and to checking our email. Our lives have moved online. We slowly erased our personalities and replaced them with our professional brands. We lost our friends to our phones, and we are lonely. For some people, Twitter and other online communities can fill that void. But it’s hard to get popular on Twitter or Instagram—you have to be clever, funny, and engage in the political and social drama that a lot of people seem to either want to avoid, or have no knack for. LinkedIn offers us a deal: Don’t really be yourself; don’t talk about taboo things; put up a professional headshot; feign excitement about your new role managing enterprise IoT applications on the edge.11 Do all that, and LinkedIn will reward you with likes and digital hugs, with messages and DMs, and with a stream of notifications that make you feel connected and important. Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer. And their likes and comments might be nudges to draw attention to themselves. But a like is still a like; people are viewing your profile; when you talk, something talks back. The conversation is real, even if the motivations are more suspect.13 And as dozens of AI-friend apps are proving, that’s worth something. Offer up your personality and a few self-promotional posts, and LinkedIn will make you feel like a celebrity. It will turn you Truman Burbank—except Truman got to be himself. In this social network, you have to be an actor too.\n",

      "Conversational response: In late 2019, Away , a startup that sells luggage, had a problem. Weeks earlier, a handful of Away employees sent The Verge screenshots of Steph Korey, the company’s then 31-year-old founder and CEO, berating staff for, in her view, not working hard enough, not being devoted to Away’s customers enough, not living up to Away’s values enough, and, in one case where she questioned if some employees were “brain dead,” not being cognitively animated enough. After interviewing a number of former employees who described the messages as “consistent with a pattern of behavior from the company’s top leaders,” The Verge published a lengthy piece charging Korey with creating a “toxic work environment” inside of Away.Korey tweeted an apology , said she was “appalled and embarrassed” by her behavior, promised to better support her team through an awkward commitment to “work-life integration,” and, three days later, was fired. 1 Away replaced Korey with Stuart Haselden , a former Lululemon executive with over twenty years of retail experience. 2 Then Korey returned as CEO, saying the initial decision was a mistake and that The Verge story contained “deliberate lies and distortions.” 3Korey’s firing sparked a number of the tech industry’s long-standing cultural powder kegs. The real story was inequality : If Korey, who grew up in a 55,000 square foot home and was at one point worth $130 million , wanted her team to work harder, she should pay them more than $40,000 a year. The real story was about inexperienced management : Rather than yelling at her support team, Korey should’ve been focused on figuring out why Away was getting 4,000 customer service requests a day. The real story was Slack : Away’s reliance on always-on chat and Korey’s insistence that employees “have almost every conversation in public” enabled executives to surveil and intimidate staff. The real story was racism : Several people of color said that they were fired by Away because they made jokes about “ cis white men ” in a private Slack channel. The real story was sexism : Had Korey been a man, she would’ve been seen as decisive rather than tyrannical. 4 The real story was the media : The article was a hit piece—targeting both Away and Slack —uncovering nothing remarkable, written by a reporter with an ax to grind.\n",

      "Conversational response: Korey’s firing sparked a number of the tech industry’s long-standing cultural powder kegs. The real story was inequality : If Korey, who grew up in a 55,000 square foot home and was at one point worth $130 million , wanted her team to work harder, she should pay them more than $40,000 a year. The real story was about inexperienced management : Rather than yelling at her support team, Korey should’ve been focused on figuring out why Away was getting 4,000 customer service requests a day. The real story was Slack : Away’s reliance on always-on chat and Korey’s insistence that employees “have almost every conversation in public” enabled executives to surveil and intimidate staff. The real story was racism : Several people of color said that they were fired by Away because they made jokes about “ cis white men ” in a private Slack channel. The real story was sexism : Had Korey been a man, she would’ve been seen as decisive rather than tyrannical. 4 The real story was the media : The article was a hit piece—targeting both Away and Slack —uncovering nothing remarkable, written by a reporter with an ax to grind.It scissored Silicon Valley in half. 5 For a few weeks, no matter your team or tribe , you had an opinion on what happened at Away, and it proved that you had been right all along.The biggest nerve it touched, however, centered around the pressure that Korey, who was known for having a fanatical work ethic , put on her employees to work long hours, over weekends, and over holidays. Some argued that this expectation was abusive; others said it was necessary, the cost of doing business as a young company. 6\n",

Though I knew the numbers were rough, I thought that this slide said that we were a serious business with serious ambitions to sell to serious customers. In hindsight, I suspect that it said nothing of the sort. And what it said instead—which was a lot—wasn’t particularly good: The slide said that we don't know who our product was for, or who we wanted to sell to. “Analysts and data scientists” is a notoriously vague set of buyers, and “knowledge workers” is even worse. If that was the best definition we could come up with for our market, it said that we hadn’t done the work to understand who might buy what we were building—or worse still, we didn’t even know who wanted to build something for. It said we were planning on casting a uselessly wide and prohibitively expensive net to find customers, that we’d probably end up making a product for a bunch of loosely related but ultimately disjointed buyers, and that our product would eventually get drawn and quartered by a user base that would pull us in a dozen different directions.\n",

It’s a perpetual online work trip, where everyone feels professionally obligated to act like friends. Over the last twenty years, we’ve all become addicted to our jobs and to checking our email. Our lives have moved online. We slowly erased our personalities and replaced them with our professional brands. We lost our friends to our phones, and we are lonely. For some people, Twitter and other online communities can fill that void. But it’s hard to get popular on Twitter or Instagram—you have to be clever, funny, and engage in the political and social drama that a lot of people seem to either want to avoid, or have no knack for. LinkedIn offers us a deal: Don’t really be yourself; don’t talk about taboo things; put up a professional headshot; feign excitement about your new role managing enterprise IoT applications on the edge.11 Do all that, and LinkedIn will reward you with likes and digital hugs, with messages and DMs, and with a stream of notifications that make you feel connected and important. Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer. And their likes and comments might be nudges to draw attention to themselves. But a like is still a like; people are viewing your profile; when you talk, something talks back. The conversation is real, even if the motivations are more suspect.13 And as dozens of AI-friend apps are proving, that’s worth something.

      "Conversational response: But that’s where the story takes an odd twist: Away was, by any reasonable measure, already successful. By early 2018, Away was profitable . Korey’s personal stake in Away was likely worth tens of millions of dollars. Away’s flagship product received a “nearly flawless” score on Wired and was called the “perfect carry-on” by Vogue . They had a podcast , a magazine full of celebrities, and a Forbes cover .In other words, what was Korey still chasing? Why did Away need to raise another $100 million ? Why did it need 50 new stores and to build “a community” for people who bought suitcases? And why did she need to pursue those things with such relentless urgency that she forfeited her own managerial values—Korey had previously said that “you can’t be your most productive self if you’re not taking time to unplug,” and Away’s mission statement once said that “all time away is time well spent”—to do so?To people in tech, the answers to these questions are so self-evident that we barely recognize them as questions at all. She did it because that’s what you do when you start a company. If your company sells software, you build great software. If it sells luggage, suitcases—and “getting more out of every trip,” another part of Away’s mission—becomes your singular calling. You become passionate about resilient yet functionally minimal roller bags, or enterprise identity and access management , or solving payroll , or whatever. You go big, and then try to go bigger.

After a six-month job search, I landed my first offer on my fifty-ninth application: A data analyst at a San Francisco tech startup with a puzzling product, a clumsy name , and, as their MTV Cribs -themed recruiting video enthusiastically put it, “Cheetos, Fritos, and Doritios!” It wasn’t the glowing gold star that I was looking for, but with no alternative, I took the job.\n",

After a six-month job search, I landed my first offer on my fifty-ninth application: A data analyst at a San Francisco tech startup with a puzzling product, a clumsy name , and, as their MTV Cribs -themed recruiting video enthusiastically put it, “Cheetos, Fritos, and Doritios!” It wasn’t the glowing gold star that I was looking for, but with no alternative, I took the job.When I got to Silicon Valley in 2012, I was indistinguishable from many of the other new arrivals. We were young; we were educated; we were mostly white, mostly male, and mostly free of student debt. We preferred to wear jeans, drink IPAs, and talk about things—technology trends, SF housing policy, bourbon—as if we knew more about them than we did. Though it would take some time for me to be fully manufactured into a tech bro—for example, I still wore The North Face rather than Patagonia, SF’s preferred corporate athleisure—I was grade A raw material.I was also primed for indoctrination in a more important way: I was ambitious. Despite the Bay Area’s cultural and natural richness, I, like most people flooding into San Francisco’s central neighborhoods, didn’t come for those things. I came for my career. I came to succeed. I came to “have an impact.”  At what or on what, I didn’t know. But in a city overflowing with achievement, I assumed I’d figure it out.\n",

Days after I started, we celebrated raising nearly $100 million in funding—until, a few weeks later, Facebook bought Instagram , a company half our age and a fifth our size, for $1 billion.

That’s the space that the most ambitious companies fill: They don’t have to be category creators in a traditional sense, but they often expand or blur the lines around existing paradigms. Notion, for example, didn’t really create a new category, but blended together parts of Google Docs, to-do lists, internal documentation software, and static website builders. Redshift wasn’t a new category—like Snowflake, it started as a simple database that was uniquely fast and cheap and easy to manage—but made analytical databases accessible to companies that couldn’t afford or maintain older generations of products. In cases like these, market maps and Gartner forecasts are the setup. The punchline is how they’re going to change.\n",

      "Conversational response: The Bay Area isn’t entirely special in this regard; DC, for example, is also dominated by one industry, and full of young careerists who are hunting the same jobs. But Silicon Valley’s giant social scoreboard has one unique complication: The innate ambition of San Francisco’s startup class is also supercharged by the tech industry’s obsession with “growth.” We don’t value people by where they are. We value them in the same way we value our companies—by how fast they’re rising. Nobody talks about the CEO of a public company that’s growing at ten percent a year, or the Oracle SVP who’d been an SVP for a decade. We talked about the people and companies on the cusp —the rocket ships, the wunderkinds, the new new things .For better or for worse, in San Francisco, these vertical trajectories feel possible. Unlike other prestige professions, the tech industry celebrates those who skip to the front of the line. Startups have no entry level analyst program, no obligatory MBA hiatus, no rotational associate sequence, no residencies, no defined timelines for becoming a partner or managing director. In Silicon Valley, \"paying your dues\" is hearsay. Through the breathless profiles that fill Forbes, VC blogs , and countless 30 Under 30 lists, startup founders are regularly reminded about those who became rich and famous by refusing to be told they weren’t ready.And so, we all chase a definition of success that can only be measured by how much faster we were moving than our peers. Every step we take, every hour of work we put in, feels like an urgent acceleration towards… something. Fueled by our time and other people’s money, we race one another to the horizon.\n",

      "Conversation response: Almost ten years ago, we made this slide for one of our fundraising decks. I thought that this slide said that Mode, which we primarily designed for analysts and other ambiguous data professionals, was a product built for a huge, $16 billion market. I thought it said that even that figure understated our eventual potential, because, once we entered our more sinister second phase—selling to the enterprise, obviously—we would be a company with $60 billion of economic opportunity. I thought that this slide told investors that we had done our research: We weren’t quixotic dreamers who had become enamored with our own toys and were tilting at technological windmills; we were shrewd capitalists who had been inspired by a hopeful vision for a better future, and by the tables in the appendix of the International Data Corporation’s Worldwide Semiannual Big Data and Analytics Software Tracker®.

Though I knew the numbers were rough, I thought that this slide said that we were a serious business with serious ambitions to sell to serious customers. In hindsight, I suspect that it said nothing of the sort. And what it said instead—which was a lot—wasn’t particularly good: The slide said that we don't know who our product was for, or who we wanted to sell to. “Analysts and data scientists” is a notoriously vague set of buyers, and “knowledge workers” is even worse. If that was the best definition we could come up with for our market, it said that we hadn’t done the work to understand who might buy what we were building—or worse still, we didn’t even know who wanted to build something for. It said we were planning on casting a uselessly wide and prohibitively expensive net to find customers, that we’d probably end up making a product for a bunch of loosely related but ultimately disjointed buyers, and that our product would eventually get drawn and quartered by a user base that would pull us in a dozen different directions.\n",

      "Conversational response: Moreover, both of us were opportunistic founders. According to one profile of Korey , she didn’t start Away because of any particular passion for luggage; she started it because her friend’s carry-on split open on an international flight. Despite initially being unsure if she wanted to start a business, Korey’s reluctance turned into cheeky ambition. “We weren’t interested in starting a small business,” she told Forbes , “we wanted to truly improve how people travel on a meaningful scale.”Similarly, prior to starting Mode, I had no interest in business intelligence software. I started it because two of my coworkers at Yammer built a popular internal tool , and they inexplicably offered me a seat at their founding table. But once in it, I was in it—trying to reinvent dashboards; writing countless blog posts about dashboards; being called, by the cruelest person on LinkedIn, a leader in the dashboarding space . 9In other words, Korey and I both stumbled into our respective businesses. Neither of us were building something that the world especially needed. And like so many founders and company leaders who get swept up in feverish ambitions and pace of startup life, we didn’t create businesses to manufacture products for customers; not really . We created them to manufacture accomplishment for ourselves. We just wanted to succeed; to win; to outclimb our peers.\n",

But it’s hard to get popular on Twitter or Instagram—you have to be clever, funny, and engage in the political and social drama that a lot of people seem to either want to avoid, or have no knack for. LinkedIn offers us a deal: Don’t really be yourself; don’t talk about taboo things; put up a professional headshot; feign excitement about your new role managing enterprise IoT applications on the edge.11 Do all that, and LinkedIn will reward you with likes and digital hugs, with messages and DMs, and with a stream of notifications that make you feel connected and important. Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer. And their likes and comments might be nudges to draw attention to themselves. But a like is still a like; people are viewing your profile; when you talk, something talks back. The conversation is real, even if the motivations are more suspect.13 And as dozens of AI-friend apps are proving, that’s worth something. Offer up your personality and a few self-promotional posts, and LinkedIn will make you feel like a celebrity. It will turn you Truman Burbank—except Truman got to be himself. In this social network, you have to be an actor too.\n",

      "Conversational response: That’s the real trap of Silicon Valley, and of other prestige industries. For aimless high-achievers—for people whose only honest answer to the question of “what do you want to be when you grow up?” is “successful”—they offer a default scale. And then, its scale becomes our scale. Though we start out working there despite the job being about shifting paradigms across scalable B2B SaaS, we eventually work there because the job is about shifting paradigms across scalable B2B SaaS. That’s the real punchline to this joke : If you work in tech long enough, this might actually become what you love.And maybe that’s ok. But at a minimum, we shouldn’t find our ambitions by accident .  If we imagine that we’re no longer in our current pond—that we got fired, or are 16 years old and dreaming about what we to do with our life, or 80 years old and reflecting on what we did—what would we care about then? Are the ladders we spent our time climbing the ladders that we really want to stand at the top of?Whatever we imagine that existential ambition will be then, we we can make it our day-to-day ambition now, but not without sacrificing our current idols. Because there will be a moment when all have to ask ourselves if we got what we wanted from this life , and the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing us he'd come for us after we die, and not when we're still living .\n",

It said we were planning on casting a uselessly wide and prohibitively expensive net to find customers, that we’d probably end up making a product for a bunch of loosely related but ultimately disjointed buyers, and that our product would eventually get drawn and quartered by a user base that would pull us in a dozen different directions.\n",

I get that greatness can often be prickly, and you can’t throw out the outbursts without potentially losing the passion. But we don’t need to celebrate or mimic that behavior; we can aspire to be more decent. For every Steve Jobs, there are thousands of us with less talent whose tempers don’t make us great leaders; they just make us cruel.Away is neither a tech company nor located in Silicon Valley .

In hindsight, I suspect that it said nothing of the sort. And what it said instead—which was a lot—wasn’t particularly good: The slide said that we don't know who our product was for, or who we wanted to sell to. “Analysts and data scientists” is a notoriously vague set of buyers, and “knowledge workers” is even worse. If that was the best definition we could come up with for our market, it said that we hadn’t done the work to understand who might buy what we were building—or worse still, we didn’t even know who wanted to build something for. It said we were planning on casting a uselessly wide and prohibitively expensive net to find customers, that we’d probably end up making a product for a bunch of loosely related but ultimately disjointed buyers, and that our product would eventually get drawn and quartered by a user base that would pull us in a dozen different directions.\n",

It’s a perpetual online work trip, where everyone feels professionally obligated to act like friends. Over the last twenty years, we’ve all become addicted to our jobs and to checking our email. Our lives have moved online. We slowly erased our personalities and replaced them with our professional brands. We lost our friends to our phones, and we are lonely. For some people, Twitter and other online communities can fill that void.

Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer. And their likes and comments might be nudges to draw attention to themselves. But a like is still a like; people are viewing your profile; when you talk, something talks back. The conversation is real, even if the motivations are more suspect.13 And as dozens of AI-friend apps are proving, that’s worth something.

      "Conversation response: Almost ten years ago, we made this slide for one of our fundraising decks. I thought that this slide said that Mode, which we primarily designed for analysts and other ambiguous data professionals, was a product built for a huge, $16 billion market. I thought it said that even that figure understated our eventual potential, because, once we entered our more sinister second phase—selling to the enterprise, obviously—we would be a company with $60 billion of economic opportunity. I thought that this slide told investors that we had done our research: We weren’t quixotic dreamers who had become enamored with our own toys and were tilting at technological windmills; we were shrewd capitalists who had been inspired by a hopeful vision for a better future, and by the tables in the appendix of the International Data Corporation’s Worldwide Semiannual Big Data and Analytics Software Tracker®. I thought it said that we had read the canon, and knew that markets were the most important determinant of a startup’s success. Though I knew the numbers were rough, I thought that this slide said that we were a serious business with serious ambitions to sell to serious customers. In hindsight, I suspect that it said nothing of the sort. And what it said instead—which was a lot—wasn’t particularly good: The slide said that we don't know who our product was for, or who we wanted to sell to. “Analysts and data scientists” is a notoriously vague set of buyers, and “knowledge workers” is even worse. If that was the best definition we could come up with for our market, it said that we hadn’t done the work to understand who might buy what we were building—or worse still, we didn’t even know who wanted to build something for. It said we were planning on casting a uselessly wide and prohibitively expensive net to find customers, that we’d probably end up making a product for a bunch of loosely related but ultimately disjointed buyers, and that our product would eventually get drawn and quartered by a user base that would pull us in a dozen different directions.\n",

      "Conversation response: The most ambitious companies are those that redefine old market boundaries. If we wanted to tell a story about our ambition, showing the size of the current market is just the first chapter. We should’ve also talked about how we expected the market to change, and how we would nudge it along that evolutionary path. That’s the space that the most ambitious companies fill: They don’t have to be category creators in a traditional sense, but they often expand or blur the lines around existing paradigms. Notion, for example, didn’t really create a new category, but blended together parts of Google Docs, to-do lists, internal documentation software, and static website builders. Redshift wasn’t a new category—like Snowflake, it started as a simple database that was uniquely fast and cheap and easy to manage—but made analytical databases accessible to companies that couldn’t afford or maintain older generations of products. In cases like these, market maps and Gartner forecasts are the setup. The punchline is how they’re going to change.\n",

Or it can be helpful, if you use it as a way to figure out—and more importantly, define, for the sake of your own focus—the very narrow market you’ll actually sell to first. That’s the only two-step plan that works: Start with some painfully small set of buyers—data teams of a particular type, college students at Ivy League schools, cheap startups who need video conferencing with screen sharing—and expand into the same market but with fewer qualifiers. And market sizing slides should explain that strategy. \n",

There are feeds; there are posts; there are likes and followers and influencers. And while Microsoft shares very little about how many people use LinkedIn, it seems to be having a prolonged moment of popularity.

Instead, everything feels planned and scheduled; every interaction is something between politely professional and suspiciously enthusiastic; every message is awkwardly formatted to be maximally viral. The only two emotions on LinkedIn are bittersweet endings and very exciting beginnings. It’s not socializing; it’s editorial calendar crosstalk. What’s even weirder, however, is how isolated LinkedIn is. It’s a vault, locked on both sides. If something blows up on Twitter or TikTok, it crosses over into group chats, into other social networks, into the New York Times, on to TV, and into conversations at parties and in people’s homes. Twitter isn’t real life, as they say, but the two are definitely intertwined.\n",

      "Conversation response: I can’t help but wonder if that’s also part of the attraction of LinkedIn: It’s a social network where we can all feel popular, even in our khakis and corporate drawl. It’s a perpetual online work trip, where everyone feels professionally obligated to act like friends. Over the last twenty years, we’ve all become addicted to our jobs and to checking our email. Our lives have moved online. We slowly erased our personalities and replaced them with our professional brands. We lost our friends to our phones, and we are lonely. For some people, Twitter and other online communities can fill that void. But it’s hard to get popular on Twitter or Instagram—you have to be clever, funny, and engage in the political and social drama that a lot of people seem to either want to avoid, or have no knack for. LinkedIn offers us a deal: Don’t really be yourself; don’t talk about taboo things; put up a professional headshot; feign excitement about your new role managing enterprise IoT applications on the edge.11 Do all that, and LinkedIn will reward you with likes and digital hugs, with messages and DMs, and with a stream of notifications that make you feel connected and important. Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer.

Weeks earlier, a handful of Away employees sent The Verge screenshots of Steph Korey, the company’s then 31-year-old founder and CEO, berating staff for, in her view, not working hard enough, not being devoted to Away’s customers enough, not living up to Away’s values enough, and, in one case where she questioned if some employees were “brain dead,” not being cognitively animated enough. After interviewing a number of former employees who described the messages as “consistent with a pattern of behavior from the company’s top leaders,” The Verge published a lengthy piece charging Korey with creating a “toxic work environment” inside of Away.Korey tweeted an apology , said she was “appalled and embarrassed” by her behavior, promised to better support her team through an awkward commitment to “work-life integration,” and, three days later, was fired. 1 Away replaced Korey with Stuart Haselden , a former Lululemon executive with over twenty years of retail experience. 2 Then Korey returned as CEO, saying the initial decision was a mistake and that The Verge story contained “deliberate lies and distortions.” 3Korey’s firing sparked a number of the tech industry’s long-standing cultural powder kegs.

Others have explicitly drawn parallels between Kobe and successful founders for the same reason.I get why VCs say this stuff. It’s visceral; it’s provocative; it gets the people going.

However, the Silicon Valley metonym has grown to include venture-backed startups in other major U.S. cities like New York, Boston, Austin, and, for a minute , Miami.

Our lives have moved online. We slowly erased our personalities and replaced them with our professional brands. We lost our friends to our phones, and we are lonely. For some people, Twitter and other online communities can fill that void. But it’s hard to get popular on Twitter or Instagram—you have to be clever, funny, and engage in the political and social drama that a lot of people seem to either want to avoid, or have no knack for. LinkedIn offers us a deal: Don’t really be yourself; don’t talk about taboo things; put up a professional headshot; feign excitement about your new role managing enterprise IoT applications on the edge.11 Do all that, and LinkedIn will reward you with likes and digital hugs, with messages and DMs, and with a stream of notifications that make you feel connected and important. Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer. And their likes and comments might be nudges to draw attention to themselves. But a like is still a like; people are viewing your profile; when you talk, something talks back. The conversation is real, even if the motivations are more suspect.13 And as dozens of AI-friend apps are proving, that’s worth something. Offer up your personality and a few self-promotional posts, and LinkedIn will make you feel like a celebrity. It will turn you Truman Burbank—except Truman got to be himself.

That’s the only two-step plan that works: Start with some painfully small set of buyers—data teams of a particular type, college students at Ivy League schools, cheap startups who need video conferencing with screen sharing—and expand into the same market but with fewer qualifiers. And market sizing slides should explain that strategy. \n",

      "Conversation response: Ten years ago, LinkedIn, which was bought by Microsoft in 2016, was a résumé and a rolodex.2 It was a career fair for tryhards, a website that you never logged into unless you were either looking for a job, looking to fill a job, or looking up how old someone was.3 Now, it’s a true social network, for work. There are feeds; there are posts; there are likes and followers and influencers. And while Microsoft shares very little about how many people use LinkedIn, it seems to be having a prolonged moment of popularity. It’s no longer a passive professional portfolio that gets updated once every few years, but a place where people post regularly, and a website—and app!—that we idly scroll through like we used to scroll through Facebook 15 years ago.\n",

      "Conversation response: LinkedIn is for…advertising our work? It’s our work lives, oversaturated in Lo-Fi. Nearly everything on LinkedIn is either a press release or a corporate blog post for our personal brand: “Official” announcements of job changes; sharing “major news” about our employers’ moves eight pixels to the northeast, and across some contrived equator, on the Gartner Magic Quadrant; AI-authored appreciation posts for the hardworking team that hosted a webinar; 300-word algorithmically-optimized stories about the best advice we ever got, or a recent moment of gratitude, or some other answer to the question, “What is your biggest weakness?” \n",

      "Conversation response: Unlike other social media networks, nothing on LinkedIn is spontaneous. No post is just a thought, or the beginning of a genuine discussion. Instead, everything feels planned and scheduled; every interaction is something between politely professional and suspiciously enthusiastic; every message is awkwardly formatted to be maximally viral. The only two emotions on LinkedIn are bittersweet endings and very exciting beginnings. It’s not socializing; it’s editorial calendar crosstalk. What’s even weirder, however, is how isolated LinkedIn is. It’s a vault, locked on both sides. If something blows up on Twitter or TikTok, it crosses over into group chats, into other social networks, into the New York Times, on to TV, and into conversations at parties and in people’s homes. Twitter isn’t real life, as they say, but the two are definitely intertwined.\n",
      "Conversation prompt: why does using linkedin feel so weird\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversation response: I can’t help but wonder if that’s also part of the attraction of LinkedIn: It’s a social network where we can all feel popular, even in our khakis and corporate drawl. It’s a perpetual online work trip, where everyone feels professionally obligated to act like friends. Over the last twenty years, we’ve all become addicted to our jobs and to checking our email. Our lives have moved online. We slowly erased our personalities and replaced them with our professional brands. We lost our friends to our phones, and we are lonely. For some people, Twitter and other online communities can fill that void. But it’s hard to get popular on Twitter or Instagram—you have to be clever, funny, and engage in the political and social drama that a lot of people seem to either want to avoid, or have no knack for. LinkedIn offers us a deal: Don’t really be yourself; don’t talk about taboo things; put up a professional headshot; feign excitement about your new role managing enterprise IoT applications on the edge.11 Do all that, and LinkedIn will reward you with likes and digital hugs, with messages and DMs, and with a stream of notifications that make you feel connected and important. Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer. And their likes and comments might be nudges to draw attention to themselves. But a like is still a like; people are viewing your profile; when you talk, something talks back. The conversation is real, even if the motivations are more suspect.13 And as dozens of AI-friend apps are proving, that’s worth something. Offer up your personality and a few self-promotional posts, and LinkedIn will make you feel like a celebrity. It will turn you Truman Burbank—except Truman got to be himself. In this social network, you have to be an actor too.\n",

For SaaS vendors, cash commitments are king. The entire business model is built around customers staying customers for a while and, to a lesser degree, up-front payments . Long-term deals offer both of these things. 3 Moreover, in some sense, annual contracts are less work to maintain than monthly ones. If a company knows that a customer will be a customer for the next year, they don’t have to renew that customer’s business every month.

Are they worth anything at all? Because the ability to move between those products, and upgrade from a 4.56 to a 4.60, is the optionality we’re paying for, in both foregone discounts and in the time we lose to distracting debates and product evaluations.', 'It’s worse than that though, because optionality has an even bigger cost: Stability. If you invest in a single tool, you can probably wring more value out of it than you can by constantly trying to find something that’s marginally better.

Multiple suppliers create variability and inconsistency; variable and inconsistent businesses struggle to improve. The same principle likely applies for having multiple software “suppliers.” Migrating between tools—or even just questioning if a tool is right, and always evaluating new ones—is a lot more disruptive than making the most out of something that might be missing a few of the latest features.', 'The two main arguments against these sorts of long-term deals are, one, products can stagnate, and two, vendors can exploit long-term customers because they don’t need to earn their business anymore.', 'Though the first risk is real, it happens more slowly than most people imagine.

Optimizing compute engines and shuffling between databases could be a revolutionary innovation that shifts paradigms by creating seamless integrations across scalable B2B SaaS products —or it could just become another bike shed for us to think about.', 'A few months ago, I said that the biggest failing of the modern data stack was its ambition to be modular . The theory sounds nice—a bunch of specialized Lego pieces, assembled together to meet exact needs of every customer, working in tightly integrated harmony around standard protocols and languages—but the reality is it’s too many options :', 'The economics never worked and the experience was dysfunctional . Worse still, the belief in modularity helped inflate the bubble, by convincing people—and VCs—that there was space in the market for every specialized wedge.', 'Maybe we get this one right, and mix-and-match compute engines don’t suffer from these same problems.

How much are you be willing to pay us to do this?”', 'What do you offer HBO?', 'I have no idea what the right answer is (the point of the question was to see how people think through it, not to calculate an actual number), but it doesn’t seem like it’d be very much? Product placement ads aren’t very targeted, so the average impression for something like this would likely be a good bit less valuable than the average impression of a search or social media ad.', 'But what if it could be targeted? What if HBO said they’d only show the Starbucks cup to people who recently went to Starbucks? What if they could offer the same deal to Dunkin’ Donuts, and promised to only show a Dunkin’ cup to people who live within ten miles of a store?', 'We may be getting there. From the New York Times :', 'On Monday, TikTok announced a new set of tools that will allow brands to create ads using avatars generated by artificial intelligence that look like real people.

But eventually, surely the same technology will get used to create ads when they serve them. If we can animate a fake avatar to read a transcript, we can animate the same avatar to read a customized transcript that speaks directly to whoever is seeing it. Talk about a product they recently searched for. Speak in their native language. Adjust the avatar’s age and appearance to make them appear as trustworthy as possible to the specific person they’re talking to.', 'And if we do this, why would we stop with content that’s explicitly an ad? Watch a James Bond movie on Netflix, and transform his car into whatever make the people on that account might buy. It’s no longer an Aston Martin; it’s a Toyota Sienna. Do the same for his watch; his suit; his sunglasses.', 'Each of us live in our own version of the internet. First, it was because the internet gave us more options: Rather than everyone getting news from a couple broadcast networks and major newspapers, we could choose the sites and blogs that we liked. Then, it was the ads: Our individual browsing histories followed us around, and we all saw ads that were personalized to our presumed preferences. 10 And more recently, it’s become our feeds: Tiktok, Twitter, and Netflix show us posts and videos that their algorithms think we’ll like.', 'Still, though we might each see a different kaleidoscope of content, each individual piece is consistent. Our online mosaics are manufactured, but other people share some of the same tiles.', 'But maybe not for much longer?

There is physical data, stored in files on a drive. The database organizes those files in some manner that makes them easy to retrieve. And when you ask the database for data, a computer uses its organizational scheme to look up the files you asked for. Historically, different databases have used different systems for organizing their shelves—e.g., Redshift might arrange its books alphabetically by author, while Snowflake might order them by length. This meant that compute engines—the librarians—couldn’t share the same physical library of books, because those librarians needed the books to be organized according to whatever version of the Dewey Decimal System they knew how to use.', 'Iceberg is an open-source Dewey Decimal System. If everyone agrees to organize their books that way, then different database compute engines could all share one set of books.

More optionality means more suppliers, more wandering eyes, and less stability. Optimizing compute engines and shuffling between databases could be a revolutionary innovation that shifts paradigms by creating seamless integrations across scalable B2B SaaS products —or it could just become another bike shed for us to think about.A few months ago, I said that the biggest failing of the modern data stack was its ambition to be modular . The theory sounds nice—a bunch of specialized Lego pieces, assembled together to meet exact needs of every customer, working in tightly integrated harmony around standard protocols and languages—but the reality is it’s too many options :The economics never worked and the experience was dysfunctional . Worse still, the belief in modularity helped inflate the bubble, by convincing people—and VCs—that there was space in the market for every specialized wedge.', 'The economics never worked and the experience was dysfunctional . Worse still, the belief in modularity helped inflate the bubble, by convincing people—and VCs—that there was space in the market for every specialized wedge.Maybe we get this one right, and mix-and-match compute engines don’t suffer from these same problems. But the modern data stack shows that optionality creates plenty of problems too: Indecision, second-guessing, and lots of lower order bits to fiddle with.

From the New York Times :', 'We may be getting there. From the New York Times :On Monday, TikTok announced a new set of tools that will allow brands to create ads using avatars generated by artificial intelligence that look like real people. There will be two types of avatars, TikTok said in a release. Brands can choose from an array of stock avatars “created from video footage of real paid actors that are licensed for commercial use,” or they can opt for a customizable avatar that could be designed to look like a specific creator.Right now, TikTok is only using generative AI to help advertisers create ads before they serve them. But eventually, surely the same technology will get used to create ads when they serve them. If we can animate a fake avatar to read a transcript, we can animate the same avatar to read a customized transcript that speaks directly to whoever is seeing it. Talk about a product they recently searched for. Speak in their native language. Adjust the avatar’s age and appearance to make them appear as trustworthy as possible to the specific person they’re talking to.', 'Right now, TikTok is only using generative AI to help advertisers create ads before they serve them.

Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer. And their likes and comments might be nudges to draw attention to themselves. But a like is still a like; people are viewing your profile; when you talk, something talks back. The conversation is real, even if the motivations are more suspect.13 And as dozens of AI-friend apps are proving, that’s worth something.

      "Conversational response: I sometimes wonder if companies that buy software would be better off signing ten-year contracts rather than one-year contracts.Typically, it’s buyers who want to sign short-term deals and sellers who want long-term ones. Go to almost any pricing page for a modern SaaS company, and you'll see two prices : 1 A big, bold one, which you'll pay if you're billed annually, and a small, higher one, which you'll pay if you're billed monthly. 2 And if you talk to any software vendor about signing an annual contract, they'll probably give a third option for a multi-year deal, which will have the lowest price of the three.The logic behind this sort of discounting is straightforward. For SaaS vendors, cash commitments are king. The entire business model is built around customers staying customers for a while and, to a lesser degree, up-front payments . Long-term deals offer both of these things. 3 Moreover, in some sense, annual contracts are less work to maintain than monthly ones. If a company knows that a customer will be a customer for the next year, they don’t have to renew that customer’s business every month. For all these reasons, getting 10,000 dollars today is better than probably getting 1,000 dollars a month for the next 12 months, and SaaS companies often offer people that deal.\n",

But it’s hard to get popular on Twitter or Instagram—you have to be clever, funny, and engage in the political and social drama that a lot of people seem to either want to avoid, or have no knack for. LinkedIn offers us a deal: Don’t really be yourself; don’t talk about taboo things; put up a professional headshot; feign excitement about your new role managing enterprise IoT applications on the edge.11 Do all that, and LinkedIn will reward you with likes and digital hugs, with messages and DMs, and with a stream of notifications that make you feel connected and important. Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer. And their likes and comments might be nudges to draw attention to themselves. But a like is still a like; people are viewing your profile; when you talk, something talks back. The conversation is real, even if the motivations are more suspect.13 And as dozens of AI-friend apps are proving, that’s worth something. Offer up your personality and a few self-promotional posts, and LinkedIn will make you feel like a celebrity. It will turn you Truman Burbank—except Truman got to be himself. In this social network, you have to be an actor too.\n",

      "Conversational response: The logic behind this sort of discounting is straightforward. For SaaS vendors, cash commitments are king. The entire business model is built around customers staying customers for a while and, to a lesser degree, up-front payments . Long-term deals offer both of these things. 3 Moreover, in some sense, annual contracts are less work to maintain than monthly ones. If a company knows that a customer will be a customer for the next year, they don’t have to renew that customer’s business every month. For all these reasons, getting 10,000 dollars today is better than probably getting 1,000 dollars a month for the next 12 months, and SaaS companies often offer people that deal.They also offer the deal because buyers prefer short-term contracts. Buyers don’t want commitment; they want flexibility. What if they discover some hidden flaw in the product they bought? What if something about their business changes, and they no longer want to use it? What if a competitor launches a shiny new thing that they really like ? If they’re on a month-to-month contract, they can simply walk away. But if they’re on a long-term contract, they can’t. They can’t credibly demand that the vendor fix whatever thing they don’t like, “or else.” They can stop using the product, but they can’t stop paying for it . They’re locked in.And so, people say , when possible, avoid it . Avoid long-term contracts. Month-to-month is better than an annual commitment; annual is better than multi-year; literally anything is better than ten years.\n",

If that was the best definition we could come up with for our market, it said that we hadn’t done the work to understand who might buy what we were building—or worse still, we didn’t even know who wanted to build something for. It said we were planning on casting a uselessly wide and prohibitively expensive net to find customers, that we’d probably end up making a product for a bunch of loosely related but ultimately disjointed buyers, and that our product would eventually get drawn and quartered by a user base that would pull us in a dozen different directions.\n",

Buy the BI tool; burn the boats behind you ; set your tools in stone. Force yourself to worry about people and process problems by taking away your other temptations.If you’re in the market for some software product and you whittle your options down to a handful of reasonable finalists, all of those tools are probably good enough. Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, Synapse—does it really matter which you choose? Will “business outcomes” be materially different because the data team chooses a BI tool that its users give 4.60 stars versus 4.58 ? Or 4.58 versus 4.56 ? 4 How much are those 0.02 stars worth? Are they worth anything at all? Because the ability to move between those products, and upgrade from a 4.56 to a 4.60, is the optionality we’re paying for, in both foregone discounts and in the time we lose to distracting debates and product evaluations.It’s worse than that though, because optionality has an even bigger cost: Stability. If you invest in a single tool, you can probably wring more value out of it than you can by constantly trying to find something that’s marginally better.

Now imagine a more pedestrian condo that a married couple owns. Which space is better? Imagine a college basketball team of one-and-done freshmen who will be NBA lottery picks. Now imagine one full of future insurance salesmen who’ve been playing together for several years .

When we buy software, we often sacrifice that stability, so that we can upgrade from a 4.56 star recruit to a 4.6 star recruit.There are business examples too. In his 14 key principles for management , W. Edwards Deming recommends that companies “move toward a single supplier for any one item, on a long-term relationship of loyalty and trust.” This is important, Deming says, because quality requires consistency . Multiple suppliers create variability and inconsistency; variable and inconsistent businesses struggle to improve. The same principle likely applies for having multiple software “suppliers.” Migrating between tools—or even just questioning if a tool is right, and always evaluating new ones—is a lot more disruptive than making the most out of something that might be missing a few of the latest features.The two main arguments against these sorts of long-term deals are, one, products can stagnate, and two, vendors can exploit long-term customers because they don’t need to earn their business anymore.\n",

But it’s hard to get popular on Twitter or Instagram—you have to be clever, funny, and engage in the political and social drama that a lot of people seem to either want to avoid, or have no knack for. LinkedIn offers us a deal: Don’t really be yourself; don’t talk about taboo things; put up a professional headshot; feign excitement about your new role managing enterprise IoT applications on the edge.11 Do all that, and LinkedIn will reward you with likes and digital hugs, with messages and DMs, and with a stream of notifications that make you feel connected and important. Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer. And their likes and comments might be nudges to draw attention to themselves. But a like is still a like; people are viewing your profile; when you talk, something talks back. The conversation is real, even if the motivations are more suspect.13 And as dozens of AI-friend apps are proving, that’s worth something. Offer up your personality and a few self-promotional posts, and LinkedIn will make you feel like a celebrity. It will turn you Truman Burbank—except Truman got to be himself.

      "Conversational response: The two main arguments against these sorts of long-term deals are, one, products can stagnate, and two, vendors can exploit long-term customers because they don’t need to earn their business anymore.Though the first risk is real, it happens more slowly than most people imagine. Microstrategy, a 35-year old BI tool, has a rating of 4.4 stars . 5 Barring some extreme event, like a business collapse or a broken acquisition, most products don’t die overnight.The second risk actually seems backwards. Like Deming suggests, loyal long-term customers have more influence over their suppliers than fickle ones. Google may not need to win Snapchat’s business every year anymore, but Google really needs to win it every five years. As anyone who’s ever sold software before will tell you, it’s not the aggressive negotiators that keep you awake at night; it’s long-term customers who are gradually getting unhappy. Those are the accounts you can’t afford to lose, and the ones you bend over backwards to serve.\n",

It said we were planning on casting a uselessly wide and prohibitively expensive net to find customers, that we’d probably end up making a product for a bunch of loosely related but ultimately disjointed buyers, and that our product would eventually get drawn and quartered by a user base that would pull us in a dozen different directions.\n",

      "Conversation response: Almost ten years ago, we made this slide for one of our fundraising decks. I thought that this slide said that Mode, which we primarily designed for analysts and other ambiguous data professionals, was a product built for a huge, $16 billion market. I thought it said that even that figure understated our eventual potential, because, once we entered our more sinister second phase—selling to the enterprise, obviously—we would be a company with $60 billion of economic opportunity. I thought that this slide told investors that we had done our research: We weren’t quixotic dreamers who had become enamored with our own toys and were tilting at technological windmills; we were shrewd capitalists who had been inspired by a hopeful vision for a better future, and by the tables in the appendix of the International Data Corporation’s Worldwide Semiannual Big Data and Analytics Software Tracker®. I thought it said that we had read the canon, and knew that markets were the most important determinant of a startup’s success. Though I knew the numbers were rough, I thought that this slide said that we were a serious business with serious ambitions to sell to serious customers. In hindsight, I suspect that it said nothing of the sort. And what it said instead—which was a lot—wasn’t particularly good: The slide said that we don't know who our product was for, or who we wanted to sell to. “Analysts and data scientists” is a notoriously vague set of buyers, and “knowledge workers” is even worse. If that was the best definition we could come up with for our market, it said that we hadn’t done the work to understand who might buy what we were building—or worse still, we didn’t even know who wanted to build something for. It said we were planning on casting a uselessly wide and prohibitively expensive net to find customers, that we’d probably end up making a product for a bunch of loosely related but ultimately disjointed buyers, and that our product would eventually get drawn and quartered by a user base that would pull us in a dozen different directions.\n",

From the New York Times :On Monday, TikTok announced a new set of tools that will allow brands to create ads using avatars generated by artificial intelligence that look like real people. There will be two types of avatars, TikTok said in a release. Brands can choose from an array of stock avatars “created from video footage of real paid actors that are licensed for commercial use,” or they can opt for a customizable avatar that could be designed to look like a specific creator.Right now, TikTok is only using generative AI to help advertisers create ads before they serve them. But eventually, surely the same technology will get used to create ads when they serve them. If we can animate a fake avatar to read a transcript, we can animate the same avatar to read a customized transcript that speaks directly to whoever is seeing it.

      "Conversation response: I can’t help but wonder if that’s also part of the attraction of LinkedIn: It’s a social network where we can all feel popular, even in our khakis and corporate drawl. It’s a perpetual online work trip, where everyone feels professionally obligated to act like friends. Over the last twenty years, we’ve all become addicted to our jobs and to checking our email. Our lives have moved online. We slowly erased our personalities and replaced them with our professional brands. We lost our friends to our phones, and we are lonely. For some people, Twitter and other online communities can fill that void. But it’s hard to get popular on Twitter or Instagram—you have to be clever, funny, and engage in the political and social drama that a lot of people seem to either want to avoid, or have no knack for. LinkedIn offers us a deal: Don’t really be yourself; don’t talk about taboo things; put up a professional headshot; feign excitement about your new role managing enterprise IoT applications on the edge.11 Do all that, and LinkedIn will reward you with likes and digital hugs, with messages and DMs, and with a stream of notifications that make you feel connected and important. Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer. And their likes and comments might be nudges to draw attention to themselves. But a like is still a like; people are viewing your profile; when you talk, something talks back. The conversation is real, even if the motivations are more suspect.13 And as dozens of AI-friend apps are proving, that’s worth something. Offer up your personality and a few self-promotional posts, and LinkedIn will make you feel like a celebrity. It will turn you Truman Burbank—except Truman got to be himself.

First, it was because the internet gave us more options: Rather than everyone getting news from a couple broadcast networks and major newspapers, we could choose the sites and blogs that we liked. Then, it was the ads: Our individual browsing histories followed us around, and we all saw ads that were personalized to our presumed preferences. 10 And more recently, it’s become our feeds: Tiktok, Twitter, and Netflix show us posts and videos that their algorithms think we’ll like.Still, though we might each see a different kaleidoscope of content, each individual piece is consistent. Our online mosaics are manufactured, but other people share some of the same tiles.But maybe not for much longer?

      "Conversation response: Almost ten years ago, we made this slide for one of our fundraising decks. I thought that this slide said that Mode, which we primarily designed for analysts and other ambiguous data professionals, was a product built for a huge, $16 billion market. I thought it said that even that figure understated our eventual potential, because, once we entered our more sinister second phase—selling to the enterprise, obviously—we would be a company with $60 billion of economic opportunity. I thought that this slide told investors that we had done our research: We weren’t quixotic dreamers who had become enamored with our own toys and were tilting at technological windmills; we were shrewd capitalists who had been inspired by a hopeful vision for a better future, and by the tables in the appendix of the International Data Corporation’s Worldwide Semiannual Big Data and Analytics Software Tracker®. I thought it said that we had read the canon, and knew that markets were the most important determinant of a startup’s success. Though I knew the numbers were rough, I thought that this slide said that we were a serious business with serious ambitions to sell to serious customers. In hindsight, I suspect that it said nothing of the sort. And what it said instead—which was a lot—wasn’t particularly good: The slide said that we don't know who our product was for, or who we wanted to sell to. “Analysts and data scientists” is a notoriously vague set of buyers, and “knowledge workers” is even worse. If that was the best definition we could come up with for our market, it said that we hadn’t done the work to understand who might buy what we were building—or worse still, we didn’t even know who wanted to build something for. It said we were planning on casting a uselessly wide and prohibitively expensive net to find customers, that we’d probably end up making a product for a bunch of loosely related but ultimately disjointed buyers, and that our product would eventually get drawn and quartered by a user base that would pull us in a dozen different directions.\n",

It’s a perpetual online work trip, where everyone feels professionally obligated to act like friends. Over the last twenty years, we’ve all become addicted to our jobs and to checking our email. Our lives have moved online. We slowly erased our personalities and replaced them with our professional brands. We lost our friends to our phones, and we are lonely.

Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer.

The conversation is real, even if the motivations are more suspect.13 And as dozens of AI-friend apps are proving, that’s worth something.

      "Conversation response: Almost ten years ago, we made this slide for one of our fundraising decks. I thought that this slide said that Mode, which we primarily designed for analysts and other ambiguous data professionals, was a product built for a huge, $16 billion market. I thought it said that even that figure understated our eventual potential, because, once we entered our more sinister second phase—selling to the enterprise, obviously—we would be a company with $60 billion of economic opportunity. I thought that this slide told investors that we had done our research: We weren’t quixotic dreamers who had become enamored with our own toys and were tilting at technological windmills; we were shrewd capitalists who had been inspired by a hopeful vision for a better future, and by the tables in the appendix of the International Data Corporation’s Worldwide Semiannual Big Data and Analytics Software Tracker®. I thought it said that we had read the canon, and knew that markets were the most important determinant of a startup’s success. Though I knew the numbers were rough, I thought that this slide said that we were a serious business with serious ambitions to sell to serious customers. In hindsight, I suspect that it said nothing of the sort. And what it said instead—which was a lot—wasn’t particularly good: The slide said that we don't know who our product was for, or who we wanted to sell to. “Analysts and data scientists” is a notoriously vague set of buyers, and “knowledge workers” is even worse. If that was the best definition we could come up with for our market, it said that we hadn’t done the work to understand who might buy what we were building—or worse still, we didn’t even know who wanted to build something for. It said we were planning on casting a uselessly wide and prohibitively expensive net to find customers, that we’d probably end up making a product for a bunch of loosely related but ultimately disjointed buyers, and that our product would eventually get drawn and quartered by a user base that would pull us in a dozen different directions.\n",

If we wanted to tell a story about our ambition, showing the size of the current market is just the first chapter. We should’ve also talked about how we expected the market to change, and how we would nudge it along that evolutionary path. That’s the space that the most ambitious companies fill: They don’t have to be category creators in a traditional sense, but they often expand or blur the lines around existing paradigms. Notion, for example, didn’t really create a new category, but blended together parts of Google Docs, to-do lists, internal documentation software, and static website builders. Redshift wasn’t a new category—like Snowflake, it started as a simple database that was uniquely fast and cheap and easy to manage—but made analytical databases accessible to companies that couldn’t afford or maintain older generations of products. In cases like these, market maps and Gartner forecasts are the setup. The punchline is how they’re going to change.\n",

The database organizes those files in some manner that makes them easy to retrieve. And when you ask the database for data, a computer uses its organizational scheme to look up the files you asked for. Historically, different databases have used different systems for organizing their shelves—e.g., Redshift might arrange its books alphabetically by author, while Snowflake might order them by length. This meant that compute engines—the librarians—couldn’t share the same physical library of books, because those librarians needed the books to be organized according to whatever version of the Dewey Decimal System they knew how to use.Iceberg is an open-source Dewey Decimal System. If everyone agrees to organize their books that way, then different database compute engines could all share one set of books.

The security and confidentiality of your data is our number one priority at Initech, and it is a shame that your information has been compromised. Our team of experts will be happy to assist you in any way we can (provided that you are on our Enterprise or Enterprise+ tier).', 'But it is also important to understand that none of this is our fault.

Our company runs on trust , customer trust , your trust , and we take that responsibility very seriously. Our software is secure by default . It is industry-leading , enterprise-grade , state-of-the-art , end-to-end , world-class . We have many badges , certifications , accreditations , and acronyms —TLS 1.2, AES-256, SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, CCPR, GxP, ITAR, IL5 DoD SRG, etc—that demonstrate how we treat your data as if it were our data .', 'So look. We did our part. But if you put 50,000 dollars in a shoebox and hand it to a stranger in a black SUV, that is not on us. If you fell for a phishing email and sent your Gmail password to Fancy Bear , 1 you messed up, not us. And if you use simple passwords and don’t enable multi-factor authentication on your account—which, of course, we strongly recommend that you do—there is only so much we can do to protect you. We make the locks, they are good locks, and we can’t be blamed if you don’t use them properly.', 'Because we use our locks properly. We have many reports from outside auditors that confirm this. We have a chief security officer; we have an official “ data protection officer .” We maintain a list of 224 SOC-2 “controls” —password policies for our company Slack, code review standards for our engineers, regular security training programs for employees, a Dropcam in our office, and many others—that are carefully tracked and tediously documented. 2', 'Still, because we are committed to transparent communication , we commissioned an independent investigation to figure out how your money was stolen.

You gave your debit card and PIN number to a thief; don’t blame the ATM.', 'In conclusion, we did our job. It’s a shame that this bad thing happened, and we are unhappy about it and all of that. But the most important thing for you to understand here is that it’s not our fault.', '—', 'A couple weeks ago, some hackers stole a bunch of data out of Snowflake :', 'Security researchers say they believe financially motivated cybercriminals have stolen a “significant volume of data” from hundreds of customers hosting their vast banks of data with cloud storage giant Snowflake.', 'Incident response firm Mandiant, which is working with Snowflake to investigate the recent spate of data thefts, said in a blog post Monday that the two firms have notified around 165 customers that their data may have been stolen.', 'Snowflake, as part of their commitment to transparency , hired third-party cybersecurity experts CrowdStrike and Mandiant to investigate the hack; they “have not identified evidence suggesting this activity was caused by a vulnerability, misconfiguration, or breach of Snowflake’s platform” or “by compromised credentials of current or former Snowflake personnel;” they said it was caused “ compromised customer credentials ” that were “exposed through unrelated cyber threat activity;” they strongly recommend that all account administrators use multi-factor authentication to protect their accounts.', 'In other words, Snowflake says that they did what any reasonable cloud software vendor would be expected to do. And while it is unfortunate that this happened, the important thing to know is that it wasn’t their fault.', '—', 'But was it? Was Snowflake to blame? Their customers? Nobody but the hackers themselves? What exactly are we supposed to make of this whole thing? 3', 'On one hand, by all accounts, it doesn’t seem like Snowflake did anything capital-W Wrong. They followed the protocols that they were supposed to follow; they built software according to the standards they were supposed to meet; no Snowflake employee stole anything, left a door open, or told somebody something they shouldn’t have. 4 They were an ATM, and someone stole their customers’ PINs. It is hard to blame the ATM for that.', 'On the other hand, Snowflake did, in a sense, make the ATM popular. Twenty years ago, most databases lived behind firewalls and were only available via VPNs or from approved IP addresses. Corporate data was, almost literally, in a locked vault that you had to physically break into to steal. Today, in part because of Snowflake’s success and its own efforts marketing the benefits of the cloud , people can log into their databases like they would any other website, through a publicly-accessible web page , 5 with a username and password. Snowflake also helped popularize using basic authentication methods like usernames and passwords as the modern standard by which data products connect to databases .', 'In essence, Snowflake and other cloud warehouse vendors moved data out of the firewalled vaults, and into ATMs all over the internet. That’s a design pattern that is fundamentally more vulnerable to certain types of hacks than the prior version. 6 Accordingly, most criticisms of Snowflake aren’t just about Snowflake, but about problems inherent in SaaS software: That simple single-factor authentication is simple to hack. When money is in a bank, you have to rob the bank to get it out. When money is an ATM, you just need to steal some debit cards and phish for people’s PINs. 7', 'But! It’s also a design pattern that we like! ATMs are convenient. Multi-factor authentication is annoying . The convenience of the cloud and putting everything on the internet is the world we asked for—and so, it’s a world that Snowflake can give us, without violating any generally accepted accessibility protocols. In 2000, had a company built a database that you could log into from a website and with the password “ password ,” we would probably blame that company if its customers’ accounts got hacked. Now, eh—we may not exonerate the company completely, but we put a lot of the blame on the customers themselves.', 'That’s the thing about data breaches, and about the entire software security industrial complex: It’s not about security; it’s about blame .', 'Most companies don’t get have lengthy security pages and pay for tedious compliance reports because they believe that jumping through a bunch of bureaucratic hoops, like logging when every employee was added or removed from Asana, will make anything meaningfully more secure; they jump through those hoops and get those reports so that, if something does go wrong, they can say that it’s not their fault. 8 The probability that companies want to minimize is not the probability of a hack; they want to minimize the probability that they get blamed for a hack . 9 Compliance standards aren’t about security; compliance standards are about liability. 10 And in the two-decade long transition to the cloud, we’ve come to shift the liability for things like bad password policies onto the users and not the vendors.', 'That’s the bet Snowflake made in making things like multi-factor authentication optional—that they ultimately wouldn’t be blamed for a hack like this. As the story escalated, 11 they’ve added the reverse Streisand : Turn a mountain into a molehill by largely doing as little press as possible , 12 and hope the whole thing blows over. Which probably isn’t a bad strategy, at least for the time being. If the important thing is for people not to think that it’s your fault—and in cloud software security, that is and always has been the important thing—you can’t get blamed for something that nobody’s talking about.', 'There’s also a broader point here. The entire corporate cybersecurity apparatus is designed to preemptively make the case that whatever went wrong isn’t our fault. But we don’t just do that with security policies. We pre-build this argument—that the important thing for you to know is that it’s not my fault—all the time, and are as frequently motivated by it as we are whatever problem we’re ostensibly trying to solve.', 'For example, when a controversial decision is being made, people will often softly object. They won’t want to change the decision, because then, if something bad happens, it will be their fault. Instead, they will just want to object “for the record”—a record that will likely get forgotten if things go well, but they’ll definitely remember if things go poorly.', 'For example, when an investor invests in a startup, they will sometimes push CEOs to make certain decisions. They will nudge, cajole, and coerce—but almost never outright instruct. Because they aren’t here to make decisions; they’re here to advise and support. If that advice works out, great, they’re adding value. And if it doesn’t, well, that’s not their fault. The CEO makes the decisions.', 'For example, when an executive asks a data team for some sort of analysis, they’re asking for counsel, but they’re also often asking for a contingency. If the decision goes well , “you can claim credit for your cleverness. If it doesn’t, you can say you just did what any reasonable person would’ve done,” and listened to the data. I played the numbers, and it’s not my fault that we got unlucky.', 'Everyone will say that the important thing is winning as a team . And in good times, sure, it is. But people are always looking for ways to buy themselves an insurance policy, because in bad times , the important thing for you to understand is that it isn’t my fault .', 'When stories like the one about Snowflake come out, the first reaction is usually to point fingers. The second is bewilderment: How could they let this happen? How could they have been so unusually careless?', 'Which, oh man, if only.

And while it is unfortunate that this happened, the important thing to know is that it wasn’t their fault.—', '—But was it? Was Snowflake to blame? Their customers? Nobody but the hackers themselves? What exactly are we supposed to make of this whole thing? 3On one hand, by all accounts, it doesn’t seem like Snowflake did anything capital-W Wrong. They followed the protocols that they were supposed to follow; they built software according to the standards they were supposed to meet; no Snowflake employee stole anything, left a door open, or told somebody something they shouldn’t have. 4 They were an ATM, and someone stole their customers’ PINs. It is hard to blame the ATM for that.', 'On one hand, by all accounts, it doesn’t seem like Snowflake did anything capital-W Wrong. They followed the protocols that they were supposed to follow; they built software according to the standards they were supposed to meet; no Snowflake employee stole anything, left a door open, or told somebody something they shouldn’t have. 4 They were an ATM, and someone stole their customers’ PINs. It is hard to blame the ATM for that.On the other hand, Snowflake did, in a sense, make the ATM popular. Twenty years ago, most databases lived behind firewalls and were only available via VPNs or from approved IP addresses. Corporate data was, almost literally, in a locked vault that you had to physically break into to steal. Today, in part because of Snowflake’s success and its own efforts marketing the benefits of the cloud , people can log into their databases like they would any other website, through a publicly-accessible web page , 5 with a username and password. Snowflake also helped popularize using basic authentication methods like usernames and passwords as the modern standard by which data products connect to databases .In essence, Snowflake and other cloud warehouse vendors moved data out of the firewalled vaults, and into ATMs all over the internet. That’s a design pattern that is fundamentally more vulnerable to certain types of hacks than the prior version. 6 Accordingly, most criticisms of Snowflake aren’t just about Snowflake, but about problems inherent in SaaS software: That simple single-factor authentication is simple to hack. When money is in a bank, you have to rob the bank to get it out. When money is an ATM, you just need to steal some debit cards and phish for people’s PINs. 7', 'In essence, Snowflake and other cloud warehouse vendors moved data out of the firewalled vaults, and into ATMs all over the internet.

When money is in a bank, you have to rob the bank to get it out. When money is an ATM, you just need to steal some debit cards and phish for people’s PINs. 7But! It’s also a design pattern that we like! ATMs are convenient. Multi-factor authentication is annoying . The convenience of the cloud and putting everything on the internet is the world we asked for—and so, it’s a world that Snowflake can give us, without violating any generally accepted accessibility protocols. In 2000, had a company built a database that you could log into from a website and with the password “ password ,” we would probably blame that company if its customers’ accounts got hacked. Now, eh—we may not exonerate the company completely, but we put a lot of the blame on the customers themselves.That’s the thing about data breaches, and about the entire software security industrial complex: It’s not about security; it’s about blame .', 'That’s the thing about data breaches, and about the entire software security industrial complex: It’s not about security; it’s about blame .Most companies don’t get have lengthy security pages and pay for tedious compliance reports because they believe that jumping through a bunch of bureaucratic hoops, like logging when every employee was added or removed from Asana, will make anything meaningfully more secure; they jump through those hoops and get those reports so that, if something does go wrong, they can say that it’s not their fault. 8 The probability that companies want to minimize is not the probability of a hack; they want to minimize the probability that they get blamed for a hack . 9 Compliance standards aren’t about security; compliance standards are about liability. 10 And in the two-decade long transition to the cloud, we’ve come to shift the liability for things like bad password policies onto the users and not the vendors.That’s the bet Snowflake made in making things like multi-factor authentication optional—that they ultimately wouldn’t be blamed for a hack like this. As the story escalated, 11 they’ve added the reverse Streisand : Turn a mountain into a molehill by largely doing as little press as possible , 12 and hope the whole thing blows over. Which probably isn’t a bad strategy, at least for the time being. If the important thing is for people not to think that it’s your fault—and in cloud software security, that is and always has been the important thing—you can’t get blamed for something that nobody’s talking about.', 'That’s the bet Snowflake made in making things like multi-factor authentication optional—that they ultimately wouldn’t be blamed for a hack like this.

The entire corporate cybersecurity apparatus is designed to preemptively make the case that whatever went wrong isn’t our fault. But we don’t just do that with security policies. We pre-build this argument—that the important thing for you to know is that it’s not my fault—all the time, and are as frequently motivated by it as we are whatever problem we’re ostensibly trying to solve.For example, when a controversial decision is being made, people will often softly object. They won’t want to change the decision, because then, if something bad happens, it will be their fault. Instead, they will just want to object “for the record”—a record that will likely get forgotten if things go well, but they’ll definitely remember if things go poorly.', 'For example, when a controversial decision is being made, people will often softly object.

Instead, they will just want to object “for the record”—a record that will likely get forgotten if things go well, but they’ll definitely remember if things go poorly.For example, when an investor invests in a startup, they will sometimes push CEOs to make certain decisions. They will nudge, cajole, and coerce—but almost never outright instruct. Because they aren’t here to make decisions; they’re here to advise and support. If that advice works out, great, they’re adding value. And if it doesn’t, well, that’s not their fault. The CEO makes the decisions.For example, when an executive asks a data team for some sort of analysis, they’re asking for counsel, but they’re also often asking for a contingency.

If that was the best definition we could come up with for our market, it said that we hadn’t done the work to understand who might buy what we were building—or worse still, we didn’t even know who wanted to build something for. It said we were planning on casting a uselessly wide and prohibitively expensive net to find customers, that we’d probably end up making a product for a bunch of loosely related but ultimately disjointed buyers, and that our product would eventually get drawn and quartered by a user base that would pull us in a dozen different directions.\n",

I thought that this slide said that Mode, which we primarily designed for analysts and other ambiguous data professionals, was a product built for a huge, $16 billion market.

In hindsight, I suspect that it said nothing of the sort.

If that was the best definition we could come up with for our market, it said that we hadn’t done the work to understand who might buy what we were building—or worse still, we didn’t even know who wanted to build something for. It said we were planning on casting a uselessly wide and prohibitively expensive net to find customers, that we’d probably end up making a product for a bunch of loosely related but ultimately disjointed buyers, and that our product would eventually get drawn and quartered by a user base that would pull us in a dozen different directions.\n",

They followed the protocols that they were supposed to follow; they built software according to the standards they were supposed to meet; no Snowflake employee stole anything, left a door open, or told somebody something they shouldn’t have. 4 They were an ATM, and someone stole their customers’ PINs. It is hard to blame the ATM for that.On the other hand, Snowflake did, in a sense, make the ATM popular. Twenty years ago, most databases lived behind firewalls and were only available via VPNs or from approved IP addresses. Corporate data was, almost literally, in a locked vault that you had to physically break into to steal. Today, in part because of Snowflake’s success and its own efforts marketing the benefits of the cloud , people can log into their databases like they would any other website, through a publicly-accessible web page , 5 with a username and password. Snowflake also helped popularize using basic authentication methods like usernames and passwords as the modern standard by which data products connect to databases .In essence, Snowflake and other cloud warehouse vendors moved data out of the firewalled vaults, and into ATMs all over the internet. That’s a design pattern that is fundamentally more vulnerable to certain types of hacks than the prior version. 6 Accordingly, most criticisms of Snowflake aren’t just about Snowflake, but about problems inherent in SaaS software: That simple single-factor authentication is simple to hack.

Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer.

      "Conversational response: In essence, Snowflake and other cloud warehouse vendors moved data out of the firewalled vaults, and into ATMs all over the internet. That’s a design pattern that is fundamentally more vulnerable to certain types of hacks than the prior version. 6 Accordingly, most criticisms of Snowflake aren’t just about Snowflake, but about problems inherent in SaaS software: That simple single-factor authentication is simple to hack. When money is in a bank, you have to rob the bank to get it out. When money is an ATM, you just need to steal some debit cards and phish for people’s PINs. 7But! It’s also a design pattern that we like! ATMs are convenient. Multi-factor authentication is annoying . The convenience of the cloud and putting everything on the internet is the world we asked for—and so, it’s a world that Snowflake can give us, without violating any generally accepted accessibility protocols. In 2000, had a company built a database that you could log into from a website and with the password “ password ,” we would probably blame that company if its customers’ accounts got hacked. Now, eh—we may not exonerate the company completely, but we put a lot of the blame on the customers themselves.That’s the thing about data breaches, and about the entire software security industrial complex: It’s not about security; it’s about blame .\n",

      "Conversational response: That’s the thing about data breaches, and about the entire software security industrial complex: It’s not about security; it’s about blame .Most companies don’t get have lengthy security pages and pay for tedious compliance reports because they believe that jumping through a bunch of bureaucratic hoops, like logging when every employee was added or removed from Asana, will make anything meaningfully more secure; they jump through those hoops and get those reports so that, if something does go wrong, they can say that it’s not their fault. 8 The probability that companies want to minimize is not the probability of a hack; they want to minimize the probability that they get blamed for a hack . 9 Compliance standards aren’t about security; compliance standards are about liability. 10 And in the two-decade long transition to the cloud, we’ve come to shift the liability for things like bad password policies onto the users and not the vendors.That’s the bet Snowflake made in making things like multi-factor authentication optional—that they ultimately wouldn’t be blamed for a hack like this. As the story escalated, 11 they’ve added the reverse Streisand : Turn a mountain into a molehill by largely doing as little press as possible , 12 and hope the whole thing blows over.

      "Conversation response: I can’t help but wonder if that’s also part of the attraction of LinkedIn: It’s a social network where we can all feel popular, even in our khakis and corporate drawl. It’s a perpetual online work trip, where everyone feels professionally obligated to act like friends. Over the last twenty years, we’ve all become addicted to our jobs and to checking our email. Our lives have moved online. We slowly erased our personalities and replaced them with our professional brands. We lost our friends to our phones, and we are lonely. For some people, Twitter and other online communities can fill that void. But it’s hard to get popular on Twitter or Instagram—you have to be clever, funny, and engage in the political and social drama that a lot of people seem to either want to avoid, or have no knack for. LinkedIn offers us a deal: Don’t really be yourself; don’t talk about taboo things; put up a professional headshot; feign excitement about your new role managing enterprise IoT applications on the edge.11 Do all that, and LinkedIn will reward you with likes and digital hugs, with messages and DMs, and with a stream of notifications that make you feel connected and important. Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer. And their likes and comments might be nudges to draw attention to themselves. But a like is still a like; people are viewing your profile; when you talk, something talks back. The conversation is real, even if the motivations are more suspect.13 And as dozens of AI-friend apps are proving, that’s worth something.

      "Conversational response: That’s the bet Snowflake made in making things like multi-factor authentication optional—that they ultimately wouldn’t be blamed for a hack like this. As the story escalated, 11 they’ve added the reverse Streisand : Turn a mountain into a molehill by largely doing as little press as possible , 12 and hope the whole thing blows over. Which probably isn’t a bad strategy, at least for the time being. If the important thing is for people not to think that it’s your fault—and in cloud software security, that is and always has been the important thing—you can’t get blamed for something that nobody’s talking about.There’s also a broader point here. The entire corporate cybersecurity apparatus is designed to preemptively make the case that whatever went wrong isn’t our fault. But we don’t just do that with security policies. We pre-build this argument—that the important thing for you to know is that it’s not my fault—all the time, and are as frequently motivated by it as we are whatever problem we’re ostensibly trying to solve.For example, when a controversial decision is being made, people will often softly object. They won’t want to change the decision, because then, if something bad happens, it will be their fault. Instead, they will just want to object “for the record”—a record that will likely get forgotten if things go well, but they’ll definitely remember if things go poorly.\n",

That’s the space that the most ambitious companies fill: They don’t have to be category creators in a traditional sense, but they often expand or blur the lines around existing paradigms. Notion, for example, didn’t really create a new category, but blended together parts of Google Docs, to-do lists, internal documentation software, and static website builders. Redshift wasn’t a new category—like Snowflake, it started as a simple database that was uniquely fast and cheap and easy to manage—but made analytical databases accessible to companies that couldn’t afford or maintain older generations of products. In cases like these, market maps and Gartner forecasts are the setup. The punchline is how they’re going to change.\n",

PodesData had to interact with our data, and was was authorized to do it in the same way as just about every other tool that connects to Snowflake: We created a new Snowflake user called something like THIRD_PARTY_PODESDATA, granted that user access to the data is that PodesData needed to see, and provided that users’s password to PodesData, via some web form inside of their application.\n",

I thought it said that even that figure understated our eventual potential, because, once we entered our more sinister second phase—selling to the enterprise, obviously—we would be a company with $60 billion of economic opportunity. I thought that this slide told investors that we had done our research: We weren’t quixotic dreamers who had become enamored with our own toys and were tilting at technological windmills; we were shrewd capitalists who had been inspired by a hopeful vision for a better future, and by the tables in the appendix of the International Data Corporation’s Worldwide Semiannual Big Data and Analytics Software Tracker®. I thought it said that we had read the canon, and knew that markets were the most important determinant of a startup’s success. Though I knew the numbers were rough, I thought that this slide said that we were a serious business with serious ambitions to sell to serious customers. In hindsight, I suspect that it said nothing of the sort. And what it said instead—which was a lot—wasn’t particularly good: The slide said that we don't know who our product was for, or who we wanted to sell to. “Analysts and data scientists” is a notoriously vague set of buyers, and “knowledge workers” is even worse. If that was the best definition we could come up with for our market, it said that we hadn’t done the work to understand who might buy what we were building—or worse still, we didn’t even know who wanted to build something for. It said we were planning on casting a uselessly wide and prohibitively expensive net to find customers, that we’d probably end up making a product for a bunch of loosely related but ultimately disjointed buyers, and that our product would eventually get drawn and quartered by a user base that would pull us in a dozen different directions.\n",

It’s a perpetual online work trip, where everyone feels professionally obligated to act like friends. Over the last twenty years, we’ve all become addicted to our jobs and to checking our email. Our lives have moved online. We slowly erased our personalities and replaced them with our professional brands. We lost our friends to our phones, and we are lonely. For some people, Twitter and other online communities can fill that void. But it’s hard to get popular on Twitter or Instagram—you have to be clever, funny, and engage in the political and social drama that a lot of people seem to either want to avoid, or have no knack for. LinkedIn offers us a deal: Don’t really be yourself; don’t talk about taboo things; put up a professional headshot; feign excitement about your new role managing enterprise IoT applications on the edge.11 Do all that, and LinkedIn will reward you with likes and digital hugs, with messages and DMs, and with a stream of notifications that make you feel connected and important. Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer. And their likes and comments might be nudges to draw attention to themselves. But a like is still a like; people are viewing your profile; when you talk, something talks back. The conversation is real, even if the motivations are more suspect.13 And as dozens of AI-friend apps are proving, that’s worth something.

This year, Databricks bought Tabular , which is a piece of database middleware that was attempting to turn an open-source data format into a product, for between one and two billion dollars .Neither deals were traditional nine-figure tech acquisitions, in which an acquirer is looking to buy a mature product, customers, and a revenue stream. Instead, they were both about hiring teams. In MosaicML, Databricks bought a bunch of experienced AI researchers (and some GPUs) in a bet that every enterprise will eventually want to train their own LLM . In Tabular, Databricks bought the architects of a popular open-source framework. When Databricks announced the acquisition, they made absolutely no mention of the Tabular product, its business, or anything that had been created from the day after its founding. By all appearances, Databricks wasn’t interested in the company, its customers, its community, or even a single line of its code. What they wanted was “ the original Iceberg team .”\n",

I thought that this slide said that Mode, which we primarily designed for analysts and other ambiguous data professionals, was a product built for a huge, $16 billion market. I thought it said that even that figure understated our eventual potential, because, once we entered our more sinister second phase—selling to the enterprise, obviously—we would be a company with $60 billion of economic opportunity. I thought that this slide told investors that we had done our research: We weren’t quixotic dreamers who had become enamored with our own toys and were tilting at technological windmills; we were shrewd capitalists who had been inspired by a hopeful vision for a better future, and by the tables in the appendix of the International Data Corporation’s Worldwide Semiannual Big Data and Analytics Software Tracker®. I thought it said that we had read the canon, and knew that markets were the most important determinant of a startup’s success. Though I knew the numbers were rough, I thought that this slide said that we were a serious business with serious ambitions to sell to serious customers. In hindsight, I suspect that it said nothing of the sort. And what it said instead—which was a lot—wasn’t particularly good: The slide said that we don't know who our product was for, or who we wanted to sell to. “Analysts and data scientists” is a notoriously vague set of buyers, and “knowledge workers” is even worse. If that was the best definition we could come up with for our market, it said that we hadn’t done the work to understand who might buy what we were building—or worse still, we didn’t even know who wanted to build something for. It said we were planning on casting a uselessly wide and prohibitively expensive net to find customers, that we’d probably end up making a product for a bunch of loosely related but ultimately disjointed buyers, and that our product would eventually get drawn and quartered by a user base that would pull us in a dozen different directions.\n",

Social hacks are those that exploit people, like convincing someone that you’re their boss and you need them to send you their email password.

      "Conversation response: Unlike other social media networks, nothing on LinkedIn is spontaneous. No post is just a thought, or the beginning of a genuine discussion. Instead, everything feels planned and scheduled; every interaction is something between politely professional and suspiciously enthusiastic; every message is awkwardly formatted to be maximally viral. The only two emotions on LinkedIn are bittersweet endings and very exciting beginnings. It’s not socializing; it’s editorial calendar crosstalk. What’s even weirder, however, is how isolated LinkedIn is. It’s a vault, locked on both sides. If something blows up on Twitter or TikTok, it crosses over into group chats, into other social networks, into the New York Times, on to TV, and into conversations at parties and in people’s homes. Twitter isn’t real life, as they say, but the two are definitely intertwined.\n",

      "Conversation response: I can’t help but wonder if that’s also part of the attraction of LinkedIn: It’s a social network where we can all feel popular, even in our khakis and corporate drawl. It’s a perpetual online work trip, where everyone feels professionally obligated to act like friends. Over the last twenty years, we’ve all become addicted to our jobs and to checking our email. Our lives have moved online. We slowly erased our personalities and replaced them with our professional brands. We lost our friends to our phones, and we are lonely. For some people, Twitter and other online communities can fill that void. But it’s hard to get popular on Twitter or Instagram—you have to be clever, funny, and engage in the political and social drama that a lot of people seem to either want to avoid, or have no knack for. LinkedIn offers us a deal: Don’t really be yourself; don’t talk about taboo things; put up a professional headshot; feign excitement about your new role managing enterprise IoT applications on the edge.11 Do all that, and LinkedIn will reward you with likes and digital hugs, with messages and DMs, and with a stream of notifications that make you feel connected and important. Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer. And their likes and comments might be nudges to draw attention to themselves. But a like is still a like; people are viewing your profile; when you talk, something talks back. The conversation is real, even if the motivations are more suspect.13 And as dozens of AI-friend apps are proving, that’s worth something. Offer up your personality and a few self-promotional posts, and LinkedIn will make you feel like a celebrity. It will turn you Truman Burbank—except Truman got to be himself. In this social network, you have to be an actor too.\n",

If you don’t put out a song, people— including the person you’re battling —might call you a coward. This is bad in a rap battle. You cannot win a rap battle without battling in it. 9But putting out a song is risky. If people like the song, they’ll make memes about it and you will score a lot of points. This will be good for you and bad for your opponent. If people don’t like the song, however, people will also make memes about it—but they will be bad for you and good for your opponent. Hence the choice, about what to do, if you are in a rap battle: Don’t drop a song and take a guaranteed small loss, or do drop and wait for the internet to decide if you put out a banger or a bomb.Ideally, you wouldn’t have to make this choice. Your best option is option three: Record the song and figure out if people like it before you drop it. Unfortunately, as a famous rapper, you can’t do this.

      "Conversation response: I can’t help but wonder if that’s also part of the attraction of LinkedIn: It’s a social network where we can all feel popular, even in our khakis and corporate drawl. It’s a perpetual online work trip, where everyone feels professionally obligated to act like friends. Over the last twenty years, we’ve all become addicted to our jobs and to checking our email. Our lives have moved online. We slowly erased our personalities and replaced them with our professional brands. We lost our friends to our phones, and we are lonely. For some people, Twitter and other online communities can fill that void. But it’s hard to get popular on Twitter or Instagram—you have to be clever, funny, and engage in the political and social drama that a lot of people seem to either want to avoid, or have no knack for. LinkedIn offers us a deal: Don’t really be yourself; don’t talk about taboo things; put up a professional headshot; feign excitement about your new role managing enterprise IoT applications on the edge.11 Do all that, and LinkedIn will reward you with likes and digital hugs, with messages and DMs, and with a stream of notifications that make you feel connected and important. Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer. And their likes and comments might be nudges to draw attention to themselves. But a like is still a like; people are viewing your profile; when you talk, something talks back. The conversation is real, even if the motivations are more suspect.13 And as dozens of AI-friend apps are proving, that’s worth something. Offer up your personality and a few self-promotional posts, and LinkedIn will make you feel like a celebrity. It will turn you Truman Burbank—except Truman got to be himself.

      "Conversational response: In 2012, it was a party. When I moved to Silicon Valley that year, it was no longer a place for nerdy rebels or idealistic misfits, but a place to get rich without feeling guilty about it. After the financial crisis, a generation of country club brats had started questioning if working at McKinsey really was the most prestigious thing that they could do after graduating from Duke, and tech offered a promising alternative. The Nasdaq was on a steady march upwards from its lows in 2009; huge tech IPOs were back ; huge tech acquisitions were back ; Google paid as well as Morgan Stanley, gave you unlimited time off, and didn’t make you work until 8 p.m. if you wanted to eat dinner for free . Back then, you could have it all: Money and status and time off, without being evil , without tucking your shirt in, and without having to leave the office for a couple (dozen) beers.Of course, the whole thing had an ugly underbelly—but the perpetrators of that era’s corporate culture weren't worried about that yet. The prevailing sentiment in most tech offices was optimism. 1 And not for some promising future that we were building, but for the present. It didn’t matter that the old cliché about tech making the world a better place was already a joke , because for much of Silicon Valley, the world was a pretty good place as it was.In 2014, the frat house got raided. The problems in tech’s basement became headlines in the New York Times . Three-character ASCII art and “locker room talk” stopped getting laughs at hack days, and started getting people fired. 2 The working environment inside Github—which, back then, was the pantheon of tech culture; Mecca ; it was every startup’s favorite startup— got its CEO fired .

Three-character ASCII art and “locker room talk” stopped getting laughs at hack days, and started getting people fired. 2 The working environment inside Github—which, back then, was the pantheon of tech culture; Mecca ; it was every startup’s favorite startup— got its CEO fired . Susan Fowler had a very, very strange year at Uber . It was time to grow up.Moreover, there weren’t just issues with how tech built what it built; what we were building was starting to look problematic too. Taylor Swift went to war against Apple. Amazon no longer felt like the ethical alternative to Walmart . Trump won, and people began to wonder if Facebook had something to do with it.Still, the core promise held: It was prestigious work that paid well. In some ways, the minor reckoning was a good thing for the brand—it was sign of progress, a needed policing of a few bad apples.

If that was the best definition we could come up with for our market, it said that we hadn’t done the work to understand who might buy what we were building—or worse still, we didn’t even know who wanted to build something for. It said we were planning on casting a uselessly wide and prohibitively expensive net to find customers, that we’d probably end up making a product for a bunch of loosely related but ultimately disjointed buyers, and that our product would eventually get drawn and quartered by a user base that would pull us in a dozen different directions.\n",

Throughout the pandemic of 2020 and the profligacy of 2021, the waves got bigger, but they retained their essential physics. And during the bad times of 2022, Silicon Valley’s annoited sages played the usual hits : Hunker down, buckle up, build on, and trust the process .It was trite, but seemed basically correct? Even if everything collapsed, the great shroud of the sea would roll on as it rolled five thousand startups ago. We would build another boat and sail on, a little bit wiser about how to navigate whatever storms and swells might be coming next.But now, man, I don't know.\n",

      "Conversation response: I can’t help but wonder if that’s also part of the attraction of LinkedIn: It’s a social network where we can all feel popular, even in our khakis and corporate drawl. It’s a perpetual online work trip, where everyone feels professionally obligated to act like friends. Over the last twenty years, we’ve all become addicted to our jobs and to checking our email. Our lives have moved online. We slowly erased our personalities and replaced them with our professional brands. We lost our friends to our phones, and we are lonely. For some people, Twitter and other online communities can fill that void. But it’s hard to get popular on Twitter or Instagram—you have to be clever, funny, and engage in the political and social drama that a lot of people seem to either want to avoid, or have no knack for. LinkedIn offers us a deal: Don’t really be yourself; don’t talk about taboo things; put up a professional headshot; feign excitement about your new role managing enterprise IoT applications on the edge.11 Do all that, and LinkedIn will reward you with likes and digital hugs, with messages and DMs, and with a stream of notifications that make you feel connected and important. Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer. And their likes and comments might be nudges to draw attention to themselves. But a like is still a like; people are viewing your profile; when you talk, something talks back. The conversation is real, even if the motivations are more suspect.13 And as dozens of AI-friend apps are proving, that’s worth something. Offer up your personality and a few self-promotional posts, and LinkedIn will make you feel like a celebrity. It will turn you Truman Burbank—except Truman got to be himself.

I thought that this slide said that Mode, which we primarily designed for analysts and other ambiguous data professionals, was a product built for a huge, $16 billion market. I thought it said that even that figure understated our eventual potential, because, once we entered our more sinister second phase—selling to the enterprise, obviously—we would be a company with $60 billion of economic opportunity. I thought that this slide told investors that we had done our research: We weren’t quixotic dreamers who had become enamored with our own toys and were tilting at technological windmills; we were shrewd capitalists who had been inspired by a hopeful vision for a better future, and by the tables in the appendix of the International Data Corporation’s Worldwide Semiannual Big Data and Analytics Software Tracker®. I thought it said that we had read the canon, and knew that markets were the most important determinant of a startup’s success. Though I knew the numbers were rough, I thought that this slide said that we were a serious business with serious ambitions to sell to serious customers. In hindsight, I suspect that it said nothing of the sort. And what it said instead—which was a lot—wasn’t particularly good: The slide said that we don't know who our product was for, or who we wanted to sell to. “Analysts and data scientists” is a notoriously vague set of buyers, and “knowledge workers” is even worse. If that was the best definition we could come up with for our market, it said that we hadn’t done the work to understand who might buy what we were building—or worse still, we didn’t even know who wanted to build something for. It said we were planning on casting a uselessly wide and prohibitively expensive net to find customers, that we’d probably end up making a product for a bunch of loosely related but ultimately disjointed buyers, and that our product would eventually get drawn and quartered by a user base that would pull us in a dozen different directions.\n",

I thought that this slide said that Mode, which we primarily designed for analysts and other ambiguous data professionals, was a product built for a huge, $16 billion market. I thought it said that even that figure understated our eventual potential, because, once we entered our more sinister second phase—selling to the enterprise, obviously—we would be a company with $60 billion of economic opportunity. I thought that this slide told investors that we had done our research: We weren’t quixotic dreamers who had become enamored with our own toys and were tilting at technological windmills; we were shrewd capitalists who had been inspired by a hopeful vision for a better future, and by the tables in the appendix of the International Data Corporation’s Worldwide Semiannual Big Data and Analytics Software Tracker®. I thought it said that we had read the canon, and knew that markets were the most important determinant of a startup’s success. Though I knew the numbers were rough, I thought that this slide said that we were a serious business with serious ambitions to sell to serious customers. In hindsight, I suspect that it said nothing of the sort. And what it said instead—which was a lot—wasn’t particularly good: The slide said that we don't know who our product was for, or who we wanted to sell to. “Analysts and data scientists” is a notoriously vague set of buyers, and “knowledge workers” is even worse. If that was the best definition we could come up with for our market, it said that we hadn’t done the work to understand who might buy what we were building—or worse still, we didn’t even know who wanted to build something for. It said we were planning on casting a uselessly wide and prohibitively expensive net to find customers, that we’d probably end up making a product for a bunch of loosely related but ultimately disjointed buyers, and that our product would eventually get drawn and quartered by a user base that would pull us in a dozen different directions.\n",

It’s a perpetual online work trip, where everyone feels professionally obligated to act like friends. Over the last twenty years, we’ve all become addicted to our jobs and to checking our email. Our lives have moved online. We slowly erased our personalities and replaced them with our professional brands. We lost our friends to our phones, and we are lonely. For some people, Twitter and other online communities can fill that void.

Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer. And their likes and comments might be nudges to draw attention to themselves. But a like is still a like; people are viewing your profile; when you talk, something talks back. The conversation is real, even if the motivations are more suspect.13 And as dozens of AI-friend apps are proving, that’s worth something.

      "Conversational response: There are your only two choices, and neither are ideal. If you don’t put out a song, people— including the person you’re battling —might call you a coward. This is bad in a rap battle. You cannot win a rap battle without battling in it. 9But putting out a song is risky. If people like the song, they’ll make memes about it and you will score a lot of points. This will be good for you and bad for your opponent. If people don’t like the song, however, people will also make memes about it—but they will be bad for you and good for your opponent. Hence the choice, about what to do, if you are in a rap battle: Don’t drop a song and take a guaranteed small loss, or do drop and wait for the internet to decide if you put out a banger or a bomb.Ideally, you wouldn’t have to make this choice. Your best option is option three: Record the song and figure out if people like it before you drop it. Unfortunately, as a famous rapper, you can’t do this. Nothing would lose a rap battle faster than people finding out that you focus grouped your diss song. And you can’t secretly release the song either—everyone knows what your voice sounds like.\n",

It could be Eminem; it could be David Guetta . We used to be able to know if a song was real by listening to it; now, the only way to know it’s real is if person in it tells us that it is.But they don’t have to tell the truth. Drake can make a song, release it under some other account, promote it without saying if it’s his , and then decide if he wants to tell people he made it. The flops can be fun fanfic. The hits can be his. But they’re actually all his. 10When people talk about the dangers of AI, they often talk about deep fakes, which are AI-generated images and videos that appear real. As bad as these are, they’re only half the problem. We’ll also have to deal with false fakes. People can now—very plausibly!—claim that something that’s real was made by AI. That dud? Not mine.

I thought that this slide said that Mode, which we primarily designed for analysts and other ambiguous data professionals, was a product built for a huge, $16 billion market.

In hindsight, I suspect that it said nothing of the sort.

If that was the best definition we could come up with for our market, it said that we hadn’t done the work to understand who might buy what we were building—or worse still, we didn’t even know who wanted to build something for. It said we were planning on casting a uselessly wide and prohibitively expensive net to find customers, that we’d probably end up making a product for a bunch of loosely related but ultimately disjointed buyers, and that our product would eventually get drawn and quartered by a user base that would pull us in a dozen different directions.\n",

If that was the best definition we could come up with for our market, it said that we hadn’t done the work to understand who might buy what we were building—or worse still, we didn’t even know who wanted to build something for. It said we were planning on casting a uselessly wide and prohibitively expensive net to find customers, that we’d probably end up making a product for a bunch of loosely related but ultimately disjointed buyers, and that our product would eventually get drawn and quartered by a user base that would pull us in a dozen different directions.\n",

It’s a perpetual online work trip, where everyone feels professionally obligated to act like friends. Over the last twenty years, we’ve all become addicted to our jobs and to checking our email. Our lives have moved online. We slowly erased our personalities and replaced them with our professional brands. We lost our friends to our phones, and we are lonely.

Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer.

It’s easy to think this, because most dbt models do, literally, create tables in a database. A company might have a products table that’s imported from their inventory management system, a charges table that’s imported from their Stripe account, and a dbt model called orders that combines the two into a table that contains details about anything anyone ever bought from the company. That dbt model will be a SQL query; the output of the SQL query will be a table.', 'But another way to think about a dbt model is that it’s a function . The data team is trying to create something—in this case, a list of everything the company has ever sold—and the orders model takes two tables as inputs and produces a new table as its output. The model is a formula that contains a bunch of computational logic that describes how to do that calculation.', 'A dbt project, then, is roughly analogous to a program. Each model is a function. The functions can reference one another. And the functions’ authors layer them on top of each other, with the goal of producing a collection of tables 1 that people can use to build dashboards and answer questions.', 'Of course, dbt Labs didn’t invent this sort of data modeling “program.” Prior to dbt, data teams used other tools to manufacture the datasets that people used to build reports and do analysis. But, the previous versions of these programs were hard to write. They were written in languages that are less accessible than SQL; they ran against databases that were relatively slow and relatively easy to break; the production datasets were sometimes complex and confusing objects like OLAP cubes. To create the orders tables in an Oracle Database 10 g in 2004, you had to design a table was legible to Oracle’s BI tool, write your own CREATE statements that produce that table, hand-code things like transaction blocks to make sure your script doesn’t nuke the entire database or send it spiraling into some infinite loop , index your new table correctly, figure out somewhere to deploy the script, and then monitor the whole thing to make sure that a missing shrink operation doesn’t grind your 10 g into useless brick. And if you had lots of models that used your orders table as an input, you had to figure out how to make sure they always run at the right times, in the right order.', 'It was hard. It took time to learn how to do it. One does not simply walk into orders tables; they take the Oracle 2 Day DBA course first.', 'The people who took those sorts of courses, however, didn’t just learn technical skills. They also learned about the art of data modeling. They learned how to organize and arrange the various functions in their “program” so that they’d be easy to update. They learned how to design efficient functions that wouldn’t crash the database. They learned how to structure the final datasets that they produced so that they would be easy to use. It wasn’t perfect, by any means, but there was a sense of rigor to the entire exercise. People wrote “ definitive guides ” about it.', 'dbt changed all this—mostly for the better, but a bit for the worse. People could construct data models in pure SQL; they didn’t need to worry about things like transaction blocks or table indexes or DDL; dbt handled the dependency graph between models and made sure everything always ran in order. Moreover, modern databases made everything much more durable—whereas an inefficient model might knock down an old Teradata warehouse or Hadoop cluster, products like Redshift and Snowflake could absorb it.', 'On one hand, fantastic. People can now write data modeling “programs” without the headaches of yesteryear. It’s cheaper, faster, and far less tedious.

Transforming some hideous log of web events and mangled Salesforce opportunity records into a useful table that tallies how many active users are in every account is computationally convoluted. There are a lot of logical steps required to write those formulae. While dbt makes it much easier to write each one—each model is just a query, saved in a SQL file—it doesn’t really tell you how to bind them all together. Should you write one query that does it all? Six queries, each with some isolated bit of logic? Six queries, with each referencing a dbt macro ?

A webhook from Intercom triggered a script in AWS Lambda; that script went back to the Intercom API to retrieve more details about the ticket and called the Salesforce API to get information about the account that the ticket belonged to. A hard-coded if statement inside of the Lambda mapped Mode account reps to their Slack handles. Another function composed a Slack message that mentioned the rep and attached a link to the ticket. A final function sent the message to Slack’s API.', 'It “worked.” Slack messages got posted for most support tickets, and most messages mentioned the right rep. But, when an actual engineer—as opposed to me, a pretengineer, a benngineer—opened up the code to make an update, they were horrified. The entire “application” was a disorganized series of Python functions that had been haphazardly glued together into a Rube Goldberg machine of namespace collisions and intertwined logic.', 'I wrote it like this because I understand how to write functions, but I don’t know anything about programming frameworks. Proper Python apps are full of stuff like classes and modules and something called __main__ ; I do not know what any of it means.

The money is merely a means to advance the mission.', 'But then we replace a limb, or two, until we finally come for the heart—spreadsheets for notebooks; notebooks for spreadsheets; SQL for analysts; drag-and-drop data visualizations for everyone; whatever you need, just sign the contract. Our bodies, Theseused ; our souls, bankrupted, gradually, then suddenly , when we reanimate ourselves under some tagline—the complete cloud solution for business analytics; human-powered AI; the enterprise intelligence suite—as hideously conjoined as the Frankenstein that lurches out of our development laboratory and into some astroturfed Product Hunt post.

So these deals aren’t about incubating an ecosystem of promising startups, but, it seems, about Snowflake buying their way onto bigger partners’ roadmaps and boxing out competitors from doing the same. I’ve said before that consolidation doesn’t have to come from outright acquisitions, 8 but can come from quid pro quo alliances . That seems like Snowflake’s approach here: In exchange for money and the Snowflake sales team selling Hex and Sigma, the two companies will prioritize building a Snowflake Native App over a Databricks Lakehouse App , or integrate more directly with Snowpark Container Services , or won’t build anything that might dramatically lower how much a customer uses Snowflake.

Can you outline how to do this?”It responds with two things: Sample code, and an outline of how to arrange that code within Django’s organizational framework. The second thing, I found, is actually more useful than the first, because it’s what kept me from turning my app into my Slackbot script.

Two weeks before that, Sigma announced the same thing . And sandwiched in between the two, Omni, yet another BI tool, said that they also raised money from Snowflake Ventures.Sigma and Hex were both already in Snowflake’s portfolio, and the latest investment in Hex wasn’t (at least publicly) part of a bigger round led by other investors. So these deals aren’t about incubating an ecosystem of promising startups, but, it seems, about Snowflake buying their way onto bigger partners’ roadmaps and boxing out competitors from doing the same. I’ve said before that consolidation doesn’t have to come from outright acquisitions, 8 but can come from quid pro quo alliances . That seems like Snowflake’s approach here: In exchange for money and the Snowflake sales team selling Hex and Sigma, the two companies will prioritize building a Snowflake Native App over a Databricks Lakehouse App , or integrate more directly with Snowpark Container Services , or won’t build anything that might dramatically lower how much a customer uses Snowflake. There’s a lot of value as being seen as star around which everyone else resolves, and Snowflake appears intent on keeping other companies in their orbit.Or who knows, maybe now is just a really good time to invest in software .', 'Or who knows, maybe now is just a really good time to invest in software .And now, a queryable semantic layer .From Rich Hickey’s famous talk on this subject , simple means the opposite of complex.

SQLMesh, for example, is mostly dbt with better developer ergonomics. That’s useful, and might sell well—we all like ergonomic things—but it sidesteps the core issue: How do we become good designers of the thing we’re building?People, including dbt, tend to measure dbt projects by how many models they have. Which I get; models are the most prominent object in dbt, and are an obvious thing to count. However, that frames dbt in the wrong way. By emphasizing models, we implicitly define dbt as a tool for creating tables. I think it’s more useful to frame dbt as program to create data assets, and dbt models as functions—and we would never count the number of functions in programs.

      "Conversational response: One way to think about a dbt model is that it’s a table. It’s easy to think this, because most dbt models do, literally, create tables in a database. A company might have a products table that’s imported from their inventory management system, a charges table that’s imported from their Stripe account, and a dbt model called orders that combines the two into a table that contains details about anything anyone ever bought from the company. That dbt model will be a SQL query; the output of the SQL query will be a table.But another way to think about a dbt model is that it’s a function . The data team is trying to create something—in this case, a list of everything the company has ever sold—and the orders model takes two tables as inputs and produces a new table as its output. The model is a formula that contains a bunch of computational logic that describes how to do that calculation.A dbt project, then, is roughly analogous to a program. Each model is a function. The functions can reference one another.

But, the previous versions of these programs were hard to write. They were written in languages that are less accessible than SQL; they ran against databases that were relatively slow and relatively easy to break; the production datasets were sometimes complex and confusing objects like OLAP cubes. To create the orders tables in an Oracle Database 10 g in 2004, you had to design a table was legible to Oracle’s BI tool, write your own CREATE statements that produce that table, hand-code things like transaction blocks to make sure your script doesn’t nuke the entire database or send it spiraling into some infinite loop , index your new table correctly, figure out somewhere to deploy the script, and then monitor the whole thing to make sure that a missing shrink operation doesn’t grind your 10 g into useless brick. And if you had lots of models that used your orders table as an input, you had to figure out how to make sure they always run at the right times, in the right order.It was hard. It took time to learn how to do it. One does not simply walk into orders tables; they take the Oracle 2 Day DBA course first.\n",

      "Conversational response: On the other hand, though dbt made data modeling easy, it didn’t make it simple . 2 The goal of the data modeling “program” is still more or less the same today as it was twenty years ago: Bring the meaning of data close to its surface. Transforming some hideous log of web events and mangled Salesforce opportunity records into a useful table that tallies how many active users are in every account is computationally convoluted. There are a lot of logical steps required to write those formulae. While dbt makes it much easier to write each one—each model is just a query, saved in a SQL file—it doesn’t really tell you how to bind them all together. Should you write one query that does it all? Six queries, each with some isolated bit of logic? Six queries, with each referencing a dbt macro ? One choice will make the data modeling “program” efficient and tidy; the other will turn it into a sprawling briar patch of tangled dependencies and tech debt. One will simplify; the other will complect .I have no idea which one is which though, partly because this is a toy problem and all made up, and partly because I—like the vast majority of dbt’s other users—were never taught how to write the program. We only learned how to write functions .For a time, every time someone sent a support request into Mode, the customer success manager who owned the account submitting the ticket would get a message on Slack telling them about it. 3 I wrote the code that powered the system. A webhook from Intercom triggered a script in AWS Lambda; that script went back to the Intercom API to retrieve more details about the ticket and called the Salesforce API to get information about the account that the ticket belonged to. A hard-coded if statement inside of the Lambda mapped Mode account reps to their Slack handles. Another function composed a Slack message that mentioned the rep and attached a link to the ticket. A final function sent the message to Slack’s API.\n",

I thought that this slide said that Mode, which we primarily designed for analysts and other ambiguous data professionals, was a product built for a huge, $16 billion market. I thought it said that even that figure understated our eventual potential, because, once we entered our more sinister second phase—selling to the enterprise, obviously—we would be a company with $60 billion of economic opportunity. I thought that this slide told investors that we had done our research: We weren’t quixotic dreamers who had become enamored with our own toys and were tilting at technological windmills; we were shrewd capitalists who had been inspired by a hopeful vision for a better future, and by the tables in the appendix of the International Data Corporation’s Worldwide Semiannual Big Data and Analytics Software Tracker®. I thought it said that we had read the canon, and knew that markets were the most important determinant of a startup’s success. Though I knew the numbers were rough, I thought that this slide said that we were a serious business with serious ambitions to sell to serious customers. In hindsight, I suspect that it said nothing of the sort. And what it said instead—which was a lot—wasn’t particularly good: The slide said that we don't know who our product was for, or who we wanted to sell to. “Analysts and data scientists” is a notoriously vague set of buyers, and “knowledge workers” is even worse. If that was the best definition we could come up with for our market, it said that we hadn’t done the work to understand who might buy what we were building—or worse still, we didn’t even know who wanted to build something for. It said we were planning on casting a uselessly wide and prohibitively expensive net to find customers, that we’d probably end up making a product for a bunch of loosely related but ultimately disjointed buyers, and that our product would eventually get drawn and quartered by a user base that would pull us in a dozen different directions.\n",

      "Conversation response: I can’t help but wonder if that’s also part of the attraction of LinkedIn: It’s a social network where we can all feel popular, even in our khakis and corporate drawl. It’s a perpetual online work trip, where everyone feels professionally obligated to act like friends. Over the last twenty years, we’ve all become addicted to our jobs and to checking our email. Our lives have moved online. We slowly erased our personalities and replaced them with our professional brands. We lost our friends to our phones, and we are lonely. For some people, Twitter and other online communities can fill that void. But it’s hard to get popular on Twitter or Instagram—you have to be clever, funny, and engage in the political and social drama that a lot of people seem to either want to avoid, or have no knack for. LinkedIn offers us a deal: Don’t really be yourself; don’t talk about taboo things; put up a professional headshot; feign excitement about your new role managing enterprise IoT applications on the edge.11 Do all that, and LinkedIn will reward you with likes and digital hugs, with messages and DMs, and with a stream of notifications that make you feel connected and important. Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer. And their likes and comments might be nudges to draw attention to themselves. But a like is still a like; people are viewing your profile; when you talk, something talks back. The conversation is real, even if the motivations are more suspect.13 And as dozens of AI-friend apps are proving, that’s worth something. Offer up your personality and a few self-promotional posts, and LinkedIn will make you feel like a celebrity. It will turn you Truman Burbank—except Truman got to be himself. In this social network, you have to be an actor too.\n",

      "Conversational response: Every time someone goes to www.benn.website , a Python application serves them a webpage. I wrote that application too. It’s a little better than the support Slackbot, but not because I became a better programmer; it’s better because I used Django to build it. Like Ruby on Rails and other web application frameworks, Django both helps you build stuff with Python and is very opinionated in its assistance. You are supposed to put certain parts of your program in specific places, and the app often won’t work if you do it differently. Because of this, benn.website is essentially a script, just like the Mode slackbot, but it’s a script with structure. And whenever I wanted to add something new—for example, “how can I use a single variable to control the primary font on my site?”—the internet (or ChatGPT) won’t just give me the code to do it; it’ll also tell me how to organize it.Roughly, dbt is functions without a framework. There are official best practices , but they’re more suggestions than guardrails—and nobody wants to read the manual anyway. As a dbt project grows, the only thing keeping us from turning it into a spidering web of entangled models and duplicative logic is our own discipline and design sense. Which takes skills many of us never learned, because we never needed to. 4In other words, dbt’s explosive popularity turned a generation of data analysts into analytics pretendgineers . We all figured out ways to create lots of dbt models and glue them all together—dbt is very good at this, it’s very useful, and people are very creative!—but most teams did it in the same way I built the Slackbot: As fragile scripts, full of imaginative workarounds that are a little too creative for their own good.

It’s a perpetual online work trip, where everyone feels professionally obligated to act like friends. Over the last twenty years, we’ve all become addicted to our jobs and to checking our email. Our lives have moved online. We slowly erased our personalities and replaced them with our professional brands. We lost our friends to our phones, and we are lonely. For some people, Twitter and other online communities can fill that void. But it’s hard to get popular on Twitter or Instagram—you have to be clever, funny, and engage in the political and social drama that a lot of people seem to either want to avoid, or have no knack for. LinkedIn offers us a deal: Don’t really be yourself; don’t talk about taboo things; put up a professional headshot; feign excitement about your new role managing enterprise IoT applications on the edge.11 Do all that, and LinkedIn will reward you with likes and digital hugs, with messages and DMs, and with a stream of notifications that make you feel connected and important. Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer.

The conversation is real, even if the motivations are more suspect.13 And as dozens of AI-friend apps are proving, that’s worth something.

I thought that this slide said that Mode, which we primarily designed for analysts and other ambiguous data professionals, was a product built for a huge, $16 billion market. I thought it said that even that figure understated our eventual potential, because, once we entered our more sinister second phase—selling to the enterprise, obviously—we would be a company with $60 billion of economic opportunity. I thought that this slide told investors that we had done our research: We weren’t quixotic dreamers who had become enamored with our own toys and were tilting at technological windmills; we were shrewd capitalists who had been inspired by a hopeful vision for a better future, and by the tables in the appendix of the International Data Corporation’s Worldwide Semiannual Big Data and Analytics Software Tracker®. I thought it said that we had read the canon, and knew that markets were the most important determinant of a startup’s success. Though I knew the numbers were rough, I thought that this slide said that we were a serious business with serious ambitions to sell to serious customers. In hindsight, I suspect that it said nothing of the sort. And what it said instead—which was a lot—wasn’t particularly good: The slide said that we don't know who our product was for, or who we wanted to sell to. “Analysts and data scientists” is a notoriously vague set of buyers, and “knowledge workers” is even worse. If that was the best definition we could come up with for our market, it said that we hadn’t done the work to understand who might buy what we were building—or worse still, we didn’t even know who wanted to build something for. It said we were planning on casting a uselessly wide and prohibitively expensive net to find customers, that we’d probably end up making a product for a bunch of loosely related but ultimately disjointed buyers, and that our product would eventually get drawn and quartered by a user base that would pull us in a dozen different directions.\n",

It’s a perpetual online work trip, where everyone feels professionally obligated to act like friends. Over the last twenty years, we’ve all become addicted to our jobs and to checking our email. Our lives have moved online. We slowly erased our personalities and replaced them with our professional brands. We lost our friends to our phones, and we are lonely. For some people, Twitter and other online communities can fill that void. But it’s hard to get popular on Twitter or Instagram—you have to be clever, funny, and engage in the political and social drama that a lot of people seem to either want to avoid, or have no knack for. LinkedIn offers us a deal: Don’t really be yourself; don’t talk about taboo things; put up a professional headshot; feign excitement about your new role managing enterprise IoT applications on the edge.11 Do all that, and LinkedIn will reward you with likes and digital hugs, with messages and DMs, and with a stream of notifications that make you feel connected and important. Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer. And their likes and comments might be nudges to draw attention to themselves. But a like is still a like; people are viewing your profile; when you talk, something talks back. The conversation is real, even if the motivations are more suspect.13 And as dozens of AI-friend apps are proving, that’s worth something.

I’ve said before that consolidation doesn’t have to come from outright acquisitions, 8 but can come from quid pro quo alliances . That seems like Snowflake’s approach here: In exchange for money and the Snowflake sales team selling Hex and Sigma, the two companies will prioritize building a Snowflake Native App over a Databricks Lakehouse App , or integrate more directly with Snowpark Container Services , or won’t build anything that might dramatically lower how much a customer uses Snowflake.

It can be useless, if you treat it as a mechanical assignment to find a big number in a Forrester report, say “we can sell to five percent of this,” and feel good about your eventual potential. Or it can be helpful, if you use it as a way to figure out—and more importantly, define, for the sake of your own focus—the very narrow market you’ll actually sell to first. That’s the only two-step plan that works: Start with some painfully small set of buyers—data teams of a particular type, college students at Ivy League schools, cheap startups who need video conferencing with screen sharing—and expand into the same market but with fewer qualifiers. And market sizing slides should explain that strategy. \n",

      "Conversation response: Ten years ago, LinkedIn, which was bought by Microsoft in 2016, was a résumé and a rolodex.2 It was a career fair for tryhards, a website that you never logged into unless you were either looking for a job, looking to fill a job, or looking up how old someone was.3 Now, it’s a true social network, for work. There are feeds; there are posts; there are likes and followers and influencers. And while Microsoft shares very little about how many people use LinkedIn, it seems to be having a prolonged moment of popularity. It’s no longer a passive professional portfolio that gets updated once every few years, but a place where people post regularly, and a website—and app!—that we idly scroll through like we used to scroll through Facebook 15 years ago.\n",

Nearly everything on LinkedIn is either a press release or a corporate blog post for our personal brand: “Official” announcements of job changes; sharing “major news” about our employers’ moves eight pixels to the northeast, and across some contrived equator, on the Gartner Magic Quadrant; AI-authored appreciation posts for the hardworking team that hosted a webinar; 300-word algorithmically-optimized stories about the best advice we ever got, or a recent moment of gratitude, or some other answer to the question, “What is your biggest weakness?” \n",

      "Conversation response: Unlike other social media networks, nothing on LinkedIn is spontaneous. No post is just a thought, or the beginning of a genuine discussion. Instead, everything feels planned and scheduled; every interaction is something between politely professional and suspiciously enthusiastic; every message is awkwardly formatted to be maximally viral. The only two emotions on LinkedIn are bittersweet endings and very exciting beginnings. It’s not socializing; it’s editorial calendar crosstalk. What’s even weirder, however, is how isolated LinkedIn is. It’s a vault, locked on both sides. If something blows up on Twitter or TikTok, it crosses over into group chats, into other social networks, into the New York Times, on to TV, and into conversations at parties and in people’s homes. Twitter isn’t real life, as they say, but the two are definitely intertwined.\n",

      "Conversation response: I can’t help but wonder if that’s also part of the attraction of LinkedIn: It’s a social network where we can all feel popular, even in our khakis and corporate drawl. It’s a perpetual online work trip, where everyone feels professionally obligated to act like friends. Over the last twenty years, we’ve all become addicted to our jobs and to checking our email. Our lives have moved online. We slowly erased our personalities and replaced them with our professional brands. We lost our friends to our phones, and we are lonely. For some people, Twitter and other online communities can fill that void. But it’s hard to get popular on Twitter or Instagram—you have to be clever, funny, and engage in the political and social drama that a lot of people seem to either want to avoid, or have no knack for. LinkedIn offers us a deal: Don’t really be yourself; don’t talk about taboo things; put up a professional headshot; feign excitement about your new role managing enterprise IoT applications on the edge.11 Do all that, and LinkedIn will reward you with likes and digital hugs, with messages and DMs, and with a stream of notifications that make you feel connected and important. Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer. And their likes and comments might be nudges to draw attention to themselves. But a like is still a like; people are viewing your profile; when you talk, something talks back. The conversation is real, even if the motivations are more suspect.13 And as dozens of AI-friend apps are proving, that’s worth something. Offer up your personality and a few self-promotional posts, and LinkedIn will make you feel like a celebrity. It will turn you Truman Burbank—except Truman got to be himself. In this social network, you have to be an actor too.\n",

Go to almost any pricing page for a modern SaaS company, and you'll see two prices : 1 A big, bold one, which you'll pay if you're billed annually, and a small, higher one, which you'll pay if you're billed monthly. 2 And if you talk to any software vendor about signing an annual contract, they'll probably give a third option for a multi-year deal, which will have the lowest price of the three.The logic behind this sort of discounting is straightforward. For SaaS vendors, cash commitments are king. The entire business model is built around customers staying customers for a while and, to a lesser degree, up-front payments . Long-term deals offer both of these things. 3 Moreover, in some sense, annual contracts are less work to maintain than monthly ones. If a company knows that a customer will be a customer for the next year, they don’t have to renew that customer’s business every month.

If they’re on a month-to-month contract, they can simply walk away. But if they’re on a long-term contract, they can’t.

Force yourself to worry about people and process problems by taking away your other temptations.If you’re in the market for some software product and you whittle your options down to a handful of reasonable finalists, all of those tools are probably good enough. Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, Synapse—does it really matter which you choose? Will “business outcomes” be materially different because the data team chooses a BI tool that its users give 4.60 stars versus 4.58 ? Or 4.58 versus 4.56 ? 4 How much are those 0.02 stars worth? Are they worth anything at all? Because the ability to move between those products, and upgrade from a 4.56 to a 4.60, is the optionality we’re paying for, in both foregone discounts and in the time we lose to distracting debates and product evaluations.It’s worse than that though, because optionality has an even bigger cost: Stability.

In his 14 key principles for management , W. Edwards Deming recommends that companies “move toward a single supplier for any one item, on a long-term relationship of loyalty and trust.” This is important, Deming says, because quality requires consistency . Multiple suppliers create variability and inconsistency; variable and inconsistent businesses struggle to improve. The same principle likely applies for having multiple software “suppliers.” Migrating between tools—or even just questioning if a tool is right, and always evaluating new ones—is a lot more disruptive than making the most out of something that might be missing a few of the latest features.The two main arguments against these sorts of long-term deals are, one, products can stagnate, and two, vendors can exploit long-term customers because they don’t need to earn their business anymore.'), ConversationData(input='what are the pros and cons of long-term vendor contracts', output='The two main arguments against these sorts of long-term deals are, one, products can stagnate, and two, vendors can exploit long-term customers because they don’t need to earn their business anymore.Though the first risk is real, it happens more slowly than most people imagine.

This meant that compute engines—the librarians—couldn’t share the same physical library of books, because those librarians needed the books to be organized according to whatever version of the Dewey Decimal System they knew how to use.Iceberg is an open-source Dewey Decimal System. If everyone agrees to organize their books that way, then different database compute engines could all share one set of books.

Twenty years ago, most databases lived behind firewalls and were only available via VPNs or from approved IP addresses. Corporate data was, almost literally, in a locked vault that you had to physically break into to steal. Today, in part because of Snowflake’s success and its own efforts marketing the benefits of the cloud , people can log into their databases like they would any other website, through a publicly-accessible web page , 5 with a username and password. Snowflake also helped popularize using basic authentication methods like usernames and passwords as the modern standard by which data products connect to databases .In essence, Snowflake and other cloud warehouse vendors moved data out of the firewalled vaults, and into ATMs all over the internet.

The convenience of the cloud and putting everything on the internet is the world we asked for—and so, it’s a world that Snowflake can give us, without violating any generally accepted accessibility protocols.

We pre-build this argument—that the important thing for you to know is that it’s not my fault—all the time, and are as frequently motivated by it as we are whatever problem we’re ostensibly trying to solve.For example, when a controversial decision is being made, people will often softly object.

It’s easy to think this, because most dbt models do, literally, create tables in a database. A company might have a products table that’s imported from their inventory management system, a charges table that’s imported from their Stripe account, and a dbt model called orders that combines the two into a table that contains details about anything anyone ever bought from the company. That dbt model will be a SQL query; the output of the SQL query will be a table.But another way to think about a dbt model is that it’s a function . The data team is trying to create something—in this case, a list of everything the company has ever sold—and the orders model takes two tables as inputs and produces a new table as its output. The model is a formula that contains a bunch of computational logic that describes how to do that calculation.A dbt project, then, is roughly analogous to a program. Each model is a function. The functions can reference one another. And the functions’ authors layer them on top of each other, with the goal of producing a collection of tables 1 that people can use to build dashboards and answer questions.'), ConversationData(input='how has data modeling evolved over the years', output='A dbt project, then, is roughly analogous to a program.

And the functions’ authors layer them on top of each other, with the goal of producing a collection of tables 1 that people can use to build dashboards and answer questions.Of course, dbt Labs didn’t invent this sort of data modeling “program.” Prior to dbt, data teams used other tools to manufacture the datasets that people used to build reports and do analysis. But, the previous versions of these programs were hard to write. They were written in languages that are less accessible than SQL; they ran against databases that were relatively slow and relatively easy to break; the production datasets were sometimes complex and confusing objects like OLAP cubes. To create the orders tables in an Oracle Database 10 g in 2004, you had to design a table was legible to Oracle’s BI tool, write your own CREATE statements that produce that table, hand-code things like transaction blocks to make sure your script doesn’t nuke the entire database or send it spiraling into some infinite loop , index your new table correctly, figure out somewhere to deploy the script, and then monitor the whole thing to make sure that a missing shrink operation doesn’t grind your 10 g into useless brick. And if you had lots of models that used your orders table as an input, you had to figure out how to make sure they always run at the right times, in the right order.It was hard. It took time to learn how to do it.

They also learned about the art of data modeling. They learned how to organize and arrange the various functions in their “program” so that they’d be easy to update. They learned how to design efficient functions that wouldn’t crash the database. They learned how to structure the final datasets that they produced so that they would be easy to use. It wasn’t perfect, by any means, but there was a sense of rigor to the entire exercise. People wrote “ definitive guides ” about it.dbt changed all this—mostly for the better, but a bit for the worse. People could construct data models in pure SQL; they didn’t need to worry about things like transaction blocks or table indexes or DDL; dbt handled the dependency graph between models and made sure everything always ran in order.

Because of this, benn.website is essentially a script, just like the Mode slackbot, but it’s a script with structure. And whenever I wanted to add something new—for example, “how can I use a single variable to control the primary font on my site?”—the internet (or ChatGPT) won’t just give me the code to do it; it’ll also tell me how to organize it.Roughly, dbt is functions without a framework. There are official best practices , but they’re more suggestions than guardrails—and nobody wants to read the manual anyway. As a dbt project grows, the only thing keeping us from turning it into a spidering web of entangled models and duplicative logic is our own discipline and design sense. Which takes skills many of us never learned, because we never needed to. 4In other words, dbt’s explosive popularity turned a generation of data analysts into analytics pretendgineers . We all figured out ways to create lots of dbt models and glue them all together—dbt is very good at this, it’s very useful, and people are very creative!—but most teams did it in the same way I built the Slackbot: As fragile scripts, full of imaginative workarounds that are a little too creative for their own good.

Behaviors are shaped by our environment and what that environment lets us do , not the other way around. So long as the big box at the bottom of Slack posts a new message and not a reply, people won’t consistently use threads. If Tesla’s Autopilot Mode lets people zone out when they drive, they won’t be fully attentive drivers, no matter what the warning label says . And if our data modeling programs are going to be efficient and durable, they need to yell at us when we try to write something different.dbt Mesh could be a start, though it’s more of a set of organizational capabilities than opinions.

Because it’s 2024, I asked ChatGPT for help: “I have a Django app. I want to create a new page where I push a button that fetches data from an external API and displays it on a page. Can you outline how to do this?”It responds with two things: Sample code, and an outline of how to arrange that code within Django’s organizational framework. The second thing, I found, is actually more useful than the first, because it’s what kept me from turning my app into my Slackbot script.

We have a special collection of features; a new idea; hope. But customer by customer, contract by negotiated contract, we auction ourselves off to the highest bidder.

Two weeks before that, Sigma announced the same thing .

So these deals aren’t about incubating an ecosystem of promising startups, but, it seems, about Snowflake buying their way onto bigger partners’ roadmaps and boxing out competitors from doing the same. I’ve said before that consolidation doesn’t have to come from outright acquisitions, 8 but can come from quid pro quo alliances . That seems like Snowflake’s approach here: In exchange for money and the Snowflake sales team selling Hex and Sigma, the two companies will prioritize building a Snowflake Native App over a Databricks Lakehouse App , or integrate more directly with Snowpark Container Services , or won’t build anything that might dramatically lower how much a customer uses Snowflake.

Which I get; models are the most prominent object in dbt, and are an obvious thing to count. However, that frames dbt in the wrong way. By emphasizing models, we implicitly define dbt as a tool for creating tables. I think it’s more useful to frame dbt as program to create data assets, and dbt models as functions—and we would never count the number of functions in programs.
