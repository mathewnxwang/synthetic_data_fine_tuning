After interviewing a number of former employees who described the messages as \u201cconsistent with a pattern of behavior from the company\u2019s top leaders,\u201d The Verge published a lengthy piece charging Korey with creating a \u201ctoxic work environment\u201d inside of Away.Korey tweeted an apology , said she was \u201cappalled and embarrassed\u201d by her behavior, promised to better support her team through an awkward commitment to \u201cwork-life integration,\u201d and, three days later, was fired. 1 Away replaced Korey with Stuart Haselden , a former Lululemon executive with over twenty years of retail experience. 2 Then Korey returned as CEO, saying the initial decision was a mistake and that The Verge story contained \u201cdeliberate lies and distortions.\u201d 3Korey\u2019s firing sparked a number of the tech industry\u2019s long-standing cultural powder kegs.

Go to almost any pricing page for a modern SaaS company, and you'll see two prices : 1 A big, bold one, which you'll pay if you're billed annually, and a small, higher one, which you'll pay if you're billed monthly. 2 And if you talk to any software vendor about signing an annual contract, they'll probably give a third option for a multi-year deal, which will have the lowest price of the three.The logic behind this sort of discounting is straightforward. For SaaS vendors, cash commitments are king. The entire business model is built around customers staying customers for a while and, to a lesser degree, up-front payments . Long-term deals offer both of these things. 3 Moreover, in some sense, annual contracts are less work to maintain than monthly ones. If a company knows that a customer will be a customer for the next year, they don\u2019t have to renew that customer\u2019s business every month. For all these reasons, getting 10,000 dollars today is better than probably getting 1,000 dollars a month for the next 12 months, and SaaS companies often offer people that deal."}]}

But people are unlikely to make that investment if they\u2019re always window shopping for an upgrade.Imagine a luxury apartment that\u2019s leased by two people who are only committed to it until a better place comes on the market, and only committed to each other until they move.

Now imagine one full of future insurance salesmen who\u2019ve been playing together for several years . Which team is better ?In both cases, the stability of the latter option is at least arguably better than the talent of the former. And these are extreme cases, of college teams full of 1- and 2-star recruits versus 4- and 5-star recruits.

Microstrategy, a 35-year old BI tool, has a rating of 4.4 stars . 5 Barring some extreme event, like a business collapse or a broken acquisition, most products don\u2019t die overnight.The second risk actually seems backwards.

They followed the protocols that they were supposed to follow; they built software according to the standards they were supposed to meet; no Snowflake employee stole anything, left a door open, or told somebody something they shouldn\u2019t have. 4 They were an ATM, and someone stole their customers\u2019 PINs. It is hard to blame the ATM for that.On the other hand, Snowflake did, in a sense, make the ATM popular. Twenty years ago, most databases lived behind firewalls and were only available via VPNs or from approved IP addresses. Corporate data was, almost literally, in a locked vault that you had to physically break into to steal. Today, in part because of Snowflake\u2019s success and its own efforts marketing the benefits of the cloud , people can log into their databases like they would any other website, through a publicly-accessible web page , 5 with a username and password. Snowflake also helped popularize using basic authentication methods like usernames and passwords as the modern standard by which data products connect to databases .In essence, Snowflake and other cloud warehouse vendors moved data out of the firewalled vaults, and into ATMs all over the internet. That\u2019s a design pattern that is fundamentally more vulnerable to certain types of hacks than the prior version. 6 Accordingly, most criticisms of Snowflake aren\u2019t just about Snowflake, but about problems inherent in SaaS software: That simple single-factor authentication is simple to hack. When money is in a bank, you have to rob the bank to get it out. When money is an ATM, you just need to steal some debit cards and phish for people\u2019s PINs. 7"}]}
