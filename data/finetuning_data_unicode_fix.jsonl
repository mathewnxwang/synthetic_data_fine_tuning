Weeks earlier, a handful of Away employees sent The Verge screenshots of Steph Korey, the company’s then 31-year-old founder and CEO, berating staff for, in her view, not working hard enough, not being devoted to Away’s customers enough, not living up to Away’s values enough, and, in one case where she questioned if some employees were “brain dead,” not being cognitively animated enough. After interviewing a number of former employees who described the messages as “consistent with a pattern of behavior from the company’s top leaders,” The Verge published a lengthy piece charging Korey with creating a “toxic work environment” inside of Away.Korey tweeted an apology , said she was “appalled and embarrassed” by her behavior, promised to better support her team through an awkward commitment to “work-life integration,” and, three days later, was fired. 1 Away replaced Korey with Stuart Haselden , a former Lululemon executive with over twenty years of retail experience. 2 Then Korey returned as CEO, saying the initial decision was a mistake and that The Verge story contained “deliberate lies and distortions.” 3Korey’s firing sparked a number of the tech industry’s long-standing cultural powder kegs. The real story was inequality : If Korey, who grew up in a 55,000 square foot home and was at one point worth $130 million , wanted her team to work harder, she should pay them more than $40,000 a year. The real story was about inexperienced management : Rather than yelling at her support team, Korey should’ve been focused on figuring out why Away was getting 4,000 customer service requests a day. The real story was Slack : Away’s reliance on always-on chat and Korey’s insistence that employees “have almost every conversation in public” enabled executives to surveil and intimidate staff. The real story was racism : Several people of color said that they were fired by Away because they made jokes about “ cis white men ” in a private Slack channel. The real story was sexism : Had Korey been a man, she would’ve been seen as decisive rather than tyrannical. 4 The real story was the media : The article was a hit piece—targeting both Away and Slack —uncovering nothing remarkable, written by a reporter with an ax to grind."}]}

Elon Musk regularly dislodges it by encouraging people to work 80 to 100 hours a week ; Basecamp founders Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson dislodged it when they published a book arguing that long hours are “a mark of stupidity;” every viral #DayInMyLife video from TikTok dislodges it . And Steph Korey inadvertently dislodged it by, among other things, preemptively rejecting her support team’s requests for time off in the name of accountability and empowerment.In this iteration, most of Korey's defenders didn't condone her approach—people couldn’t quite contort themselves into saying that calling her team braindead was reasonable. But many people, and especially venture capitalists and their social barnacles, defended her willingness to do whatever it takes to succeed. Rather than criticizing her managerial style, they said, we should applaud her “strong devotion” to her customers and her “meticulous care about the integrity of the product offered.” As one anonymous venture capitalist said , \"many VCs are reading it and recognizing the culture as the one they would love to see across their portfolio.”"}]}

We were young; we were educated; we were mostly white, mostly male, and mostly free of student debt. We preferred to wear jeans, drink IPAs, and talk about things—technology trends, SF housing policy, bourbon—as if we knew more about them than we did. Though it would take some time for me to be fully manufactured into a tech bro—for example, I still wore The North Face rather than Patagonia, SF’s preferred corporate athleisure—I was grade A raw material.I was also primed for indoctrination in a more important way: I was ambitious.

Days after I started, we celebrated raising nearly $100 million in funding—until, a few weeks later, Facebook bought Instagram , a company half our age and a fifth our size, for $1 billion. We lionized coworkers who left to join smaller companies or start their own; we wrote off coworkers who left for established giants like Google or Amazon, as if they were retiring. 8That was the only ruler by which we measured ourselves in San Francisco: How much money had your employer raised, how much hype did it have, and how early did you join?

Unlike other prestige professions, the tech industry celebrates those who skip to the front of the line. Startups have no entry level analyst program, no obligatory MBA hiatus, no rotational associate sequence, no residencies, no defined timelines for becoming a partner or managing director. In Silicon Valley, \"paying your dues\" is hearsay. Through the breathless profiles that fill Forbes, VC blogs , and countless 30 Under 30 lists, startup founders are regularly reminded about those who became rich and famous by refusing to be told they weren’t ready.And so, we all chase a definition of success that can only be measured by how much faster we were moving than our peers. Every step we take, every hour of work we put in, feels like an urgent acceleration towards… something. Fueled by our time and other people’s money, we race one another to the horizon."}]}

According to one profile of Korey , she didn’t start Away because of any particular passion for luggage; she started it because her friend’s carry-on split open on an international flight. Despite initially being unsure if she wanted to start a business, Korey’s reluctance turned into cheeky ambition. “We weren’t interested in starting a small business,” she told Forbes , “we wanted to truly improve how people travel on a meaningful scale.”Similarly, prior to starting Mode, I had no interest in business intelligence software. I started it because two of my coworkers at Yammer built a popular internal tool , and they inexplicably offered me a seat at their founding table. But once in it, I was in it—trying to reinvent dashboards; writing countless blog posts about dashboards; being called, by the cruelest person on LinkedIn, a leader in the dashboarding space . 9In other words, Korey and I both stumbled into our respective businesses. Neither of us were building something that the world especially needed. And like so many founders and company leaders who get swept up in feverish ambitions and pace of startup life, we didn’t create businesses to manufacture products for customers; not really .

Others have explicitly drawn parallels between Kobe and successful founders for the same reason.I get why VCs say this stuff. It’s visceral; it’s provocative; it gets the people going. As a lifelong amateur athlete, my YouTube history is littered with Tiger fist pumps , kick-sixes , buzzer beaters and double bangs , 10 bat flips , home run mics , Nike and Under Armour ads, and Minneapolis Miracle remixes .

The things that matter to you are the things that matter to it. For better or for worse, it puts blinders on your ambitions: You obsess over success in your field, and wonder why people in other fields stress about the trivial status games in theirs. 12And then…you don’t. Your calendar is cleared; your to-do list is zeroed; your problems are suddenly someone else's responsibility. You're pulled from the water that you long ago forgot was water, and dropped directly onto the land.Standing on the shore, your old pond—the pond where you did your life's work, in which nothing seemed more important than being a big fish—suddenly looks like all the other ponds you used to care so little about.

For aimless high-achievers—for people whose only honest answer to the question of “what do you want to be when you grow up?” is “successful”—they offer a default scale. And then, its scale becomes our scale. Though we start out working there despite the job being about shifting paradigms across scalable B2B SaaS, we eventually work there because the job is about shifting paradigms across scalable B2B SaaS.

Go to almost any pricing page for a modern SaaS company, and you'll see two prices : 1 A big, bold one, which you'll pay if you're billed annually, and a small, higher one, which you'll pay if you're billed monthly. 2 And if you talk to any software vendor about signing an annual contract, they'll probably give a third option for a multi-year deal, which will have the lowest price of the three.The logic behind this sort of discounting is straightforward. For SaaS vendors, cash commitments are king. The entire business model is built around customers staying customers for a while and, to a lesser degree, up-front payments . Long-term deals offer both of these things. 3 Moreover, in some sense, annual contracts are less work to maintain than monthly ones. If a company knows that a customer will be a customer for the next year, they don’t have to renew that customer’s business every month. For all these reasons, getting 10,000 dollars today is better than probably getting 1,000 dollars a month for the next 12 months, and SaaS companies often offer people that deal."}]}

If you invest in a single tool, you can probably wring more value out of it than you can by constantly trying to find something that’s marginally better. But people are unlikely to make that investment if they’re always window shopping for an upgrade.Imagine a luxury apartment that’s leased by two people who are only committed to it until a better place comes on the market, and only committed to each other until they move. Now imagine a more pedestrian condo that a married couple owns. Which space is better? Imagine a college basketball team of one-and-done freshmen who will be NBA lottery picks. Now imagine one full of future insurance salesmen who’ve been playing together for several years . Which team is better ?In both cases, the stability of the latter option is at least arguably better than the talent of the former. And these are extreme cases, of college teams full of 1- and 2-star recruits versus 4- and 5-star recruits.

Like Deming suggests, loyal long-term customers have more influence over their suppliers than fickle ones. Google may not need to win Snapchat’s business every year anymore, but Google really needs to win it every five years. As anyone who’s ever sold software before will tell you, it’s not the aggressive negotiators that keep you awake at night; it’s long-term customers who are gradually getting unhappy.

They followed the protocols that they were supposed to follow; they built software according to the standards they were supposed to meet; no Snowflake employee stole anything, left a door open, or told somebody something they shouldn’t have. 4 They were an ATM, and someone stole their customers’ PINs. It is hard to blame the ATM for that.On the other hand, Snowflake did, in a sense, make the ATM popular. Twenty years ago, most databases lived behind firewalls and were only available via VPNs or from approved IP addresses. Corporate data was, almost literally, in a locked vault that you had to physically break into to steal. Today, in part because of Snowflake’s success and its own efforts marketing the benefits of the cloud , people can log into their databases like they would any other website, through a publicly-accessible web page , 5 with a username and password. Snowflake also helped popularize using basic authentication methods like usernames and passwords as the modern standard by which data products connect to databases .In essence, Snowflake and other cloud warehouse vendors moved data out of the firewalled vaults, and into ATMs all over the internet. That’s a design pattern that is fundamentally more vulnerable to certain types of hacks than the prior version. 6 Accordingly, most criticisms of Snowflake aren’t just about Snowflake, but about problems inherent in SaaS software: That simple single-factor authentication is simple to hack. When money is in a bank, you have to rob the bank to get it out. When money is an ATM, you just need to steal some debit cards and phish for people’s PINs. 7"}]}

As the story escalated, 11 they’ve added the reverse Streisand : Turn a mountain into a molehill by largely doing as little press as possible , 12 and hope the whole thing blows over. Which probably isn’t a bad strategy, at least for the time being. If the important thing is for people not to think that it’s your fault—and in cloud software security, that is and always has been the important thing—you can’t get blamed for something that nobody’s talking about."}]}

They won’t want to change the decision, because then, if something bad happens, it will be their fault. Instead, they will just want to object “for the record”—a record that will likely get forgotten if things go well, but they’ll definitely remember if things go poorly.For example, when an investor invests in a startup, they will sometimes push CEOs to make certain decisions. They will nudge, cajole, and coerce—but almost never outright instruct. Because they aren’t here to make decisions; they’re here to advise and support. If that advice works out, great, they’re adding value. And if it doesn’t, well, that’s not their fault. The CEO makes the decisions.For example, when an executive asks a data team for some sort of analysis, they’re asking for counsel, but they’re also often asking for a contingency. If the decision goes well , “you can claim credit for your cleverness. If it doesn’t, you can say you just did what any reasonable person would’ve done,” and listened to the data. I played the numbers, and it’s not my fault that we got unlucky."}]}

Another AI startup that has a bunch of employees with low Erdos numbers to “ Attention is All You Need ” (Attention numbers? I don’t know) raised 220 million dollars less than a year after being founded.

I thought that this slide said that Mode, which we primarily designed for analysts and other ambiguous data professionals, was a product built for a huge, $16 billion market. I thought it said that even that figure understated our eventual potential, because, once we entered our more sinister second phase—selling to the enterprise, obviously—we would be a company with $60 billion of economic opportunity. I thought that this slide told investors that we had done our research: We weren’t quixotic dreamers who had become enamored with our own toys and were tilting at technological windmills; we were shrewd capitalists who had been inspired by a hopeful vision for a better future, and by the tables in the appendix of the International Data Corporation’s Worldwide Semiannual Big Data and Analytics Software Tracker®. I thought it said that we had read the canon, and knew that markets were the most important determinant of a startup’s success. Though I knew the numbers were rough, I thought that this slide said that we were a serious business with serious ambitions to sell to serious customers. In hindsight, I suspect that it said nothing of the sort. And what it said instead—which was a lot—wasn’t particularly good: The slide said that we don't know who our product was for, or who we wanted to sell to. “Analysts and data scientists” is a notoriously vague set of buyers, and “knowledge workers” is even worse. If that was the best definition we could come up with for our market, it said that we hadn’t done the work to understand who might buy what we were building—or worse still, we didn’t even know who wanted to build something for. It said we were planning on casting a uselessly wide and prohibitively expensive net to find customers, that we’d probably end up making a product for a bunch of loosely related but ultimately disjointed buyers, and that our product would eventually get drawn and quartered by a user base that would pull us in a dozen different directions."}]}

That’s the space that the most ambitious companies fill: They don’t have to be category creators in a traditional sense, but they often expand or blur the lines around existing paradigms. Notion, for example, didn’t really create a new category, but blended together parts of Google Docs, to-do lists, internal documentation software, and static website builders. Redshift wasn’t a new category—like Snowflake, it started as a simple database that was uniquely fast and cheap and easy to manage—but made analytical databases accessible to companies that couldn’t afford or maintain older generations of products.

It’s a perpetual online work trip, where everyone feels professionally obligated to act like friends. Over the last twenty years, we’ve all become addicted to our jobs and to checking our email. Our lives have moved online. We slowly erased our personalities and replaced them with our professional brands. We lost our friends to our phones, and we are lonely. For some people, Twitter and other online communities can fill that void. But it’s hard to get popular on Twitter or Instagram—you have to be clever, funny, and engage in the political and social drama that a lot of people seem to either want to avoid, or have no knack for. LinkedIn offers us a deal: Don’t really be yourself; don’t talk about taboo things; put up a professional headshot; feign excitement about your new role managing enterprise IoT applications on the edge.11 Do all that, and LinkedIn will reward you with likes and digital hugs, with messages and DMs, and with a stream of notifications that make you feel connected and important. Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer. And their likes and comments might be nudges to draw attention to themselves. But a like is still a like; people are viewing your profile; when you talk, something talks back. The conversation is real, even if the motivations are more suspect.13 And as dozens of AI-friend apps are proving, that’s worth something. Offer up your personality and a few self-promotional posts, and LinkedIn will make you feel like a celebrity. It will turn you Truman Burbank—except Truman got to be himself. In this social network, you have to be an actor too."}]}
