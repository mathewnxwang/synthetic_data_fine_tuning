what happened with Away's leadership in 2019?,"In late 2019, Away , a startup that sells luggage, had a problem. Weeks earlier, a handful of Away employees sent The Verge screenshots of Steph Korey, the company’s then 31-year-old founder and CEO, berating staff for, in her view, not working hard enough, not being devoted to Away’s customers enough, not living up to Away’s values enough, and, in one case where she questioned if some employees were “brain dead,” not being cognitively animated enough. After interviewing a number of former employees who described the messages as “consistent with a pattern of behavior from the company’s top leaders,” The Verge published a lengthy piece charging Korey with creating a “toxic work environment” inside of Away.Korey tweeted an apology , said she was “appalled and embarrassed” by her behavior, promised to better support her team through an awkward commitment to “work-life integration,” and, three days later, was fired. 1 Away replaced Korey with Stuart Haselden , a former Lululemon executive with over twenty years of retail experience. 2 Then Korey returned as CEO, saying the initial decision was a mistake and that The Verge story contained “deliberate lies and distortions.” 3Korey’s firing sparked a number of the tech industry’s long-standing cultural powder kegs. The real story was inequality : If Korey, who grew up in a 55,000 square foot home and was at one point worth $130 million , wanted her team to work harder, she should pay them more than $40,000 a year. The real story was about inexperienced management : Rather than yelling at her support team, Korey should’ve been focused on figuring out why Away was getting 4,000 customer service requests a day. The real story was Slack : Away’s reliance on always-on chat and Korey’s insistence that employees “have almost every conversation in public” enabled executives to surveil and intimidate staff. The real story was racism : Several people of color said that they were fired by Away because they made jokes about “ cis white men ” in a private Slack channel. The real story was sexism : Had Korey been a man, she would’ve been seen as decisive rather than tyrannical. 4 The real story was the media : The article was a hit piece—targeting both Away and Slack —uncovering nothing remarkable, written by a reporter with an ax to grind.",1
what were the key issues surrounding Korey's firing at Away?,"Korey’s firing sparked a number of the tech industry’s long-standing cultural powder kegs.

Some argued that this expectation was abusive; others said it was necessary, the cost of doing business as a young company. 6",1
What are the different perspectives on work-life balance in startup culture?,"The biggest nerve it touched, however, centered around the pressure that Korey, who was known for having a fanatical work ethic , put on her employees to work long hours, over weekends, and over holidays. Some argued that this expectation was abusive; others said it was necessary, the cost of doing business as a young company. 6This debate over work-life balance was not new; it’s a fault line that frequently shakes up Silicon Valley’s chattering class. Elon Musk regularly dislodges it by encouraging people to work 80 to 100 hours a week ; Basecamp founders Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson dislodged it when they published a book arguing that long hours are “a mark of stupidity;” every viral #DayInMyLife video from TikTok dislodges it . And Steph Korey inadvertently dislodged it by, among other things, preemptively rejecting her support team’s requests for time off in the name of accountability and empowerment.In this iteration, most of Korey's defenders didn't condone her approach—people couldn’t quite contort themselves into saying that calling her team braindead was reasonable. But many people, and especially venture capitalists and their social barnacles, defended her willingness to do whatever it takes to succeed. Rather than criticizing her managerial style, they said, we should applaud her “strong devotion” to her customers and her “meticulous care about the integrity of the product offered.” As one anonymous venture capitalist said , ""many VCs are reading it and recognizing the culture as the one they would love to see across their portfolio.”",1

Most companies won't succeed unless the people building them are obsessively devoted to that endeavor. 7But that’s where the story takes an odd twist: Away was, by any reasonable measure, already successful. By early 2018, Away was profitable . Korey’s personal stake in Away was likely worth tens of millions of dollars. Away’s flagship product received a “nearly flawless” score on Wired and was called the “perfect carry-on” by Vogue . They had a podcast , a magazine full of celebrities, and a Forbes cover .",0

Away’s flagship product received a “nearly flawless” score on Wired and was called the “perfect carry-on” by Vogue . They had a podcast , a magazine full of celebrities, and a Forbes cover .In other words, what was Korey still chasing? Why did Away need to raise another $100 million ? Why did it need 50 new stores and to build “a community” for people who bought suitcases? And why did she need to pursue those things with such relentless urgency that she forfeited her own managerial values—Korey had previously said that “you can’t be your most productive self if you’re not taking time to unplug,” and Away’s mission statement once said that “all time away is time well spent”—to do so?To people in tech, the answers to these questions are so self-evident that we barely recognize them as questions at all. She did it because that’s what you do when you start a company. If your company sells software, you build great software. If it sells luggage, suitcases—and “getting more out of every trip,” another part of Away’s mission—becomes your singular calling. You become passionate about resilient yet functionally minimal roller bags, or enterprise identity and access management , or solving payroll , or whatever. You go big, and then try to go bigger. In Silicon Valley, we’ve drowned ourselves so deeply in this ethos that we no longer realize that we’re in the water .",0

In Silicon Valley, we’ve drowned ourselves so deeply in this ethos that we no longer realize that we’re in the water .In 2011, I was desperate, in a way that only a trophy-chasing twenty-four millennial can be desperate: My first job out of college, a junior analyst at a think tank in Washington, DC, was stalling, my grad school applications had been rejected, and I was running out of blue chip consulting firms, investment banks, and tech companies to apply to. Like so many other applicants for those positions, I didn’t know if I’d like doing these jobs; I only knew I’d like them on my resume. They weren’t passions, or even hobbies; they were the next opportunity for extrinsic validation . Thus far, the arc of my life—apply to college, go to college, apply for a vaguely prestigious job or smug fellowship, take the most notable one—had been mapped by others, and I figured I’d again drift towards my next “success.”I did not make it as far as I’d hoped. After a six-month job search, I landed my first offer on my fifty-ninth application: A data analyst at a San Francisco tech startup with a puzzling product, a clumsy name , and, as their MTV Cribs -themed recruiting video enthusiastically put it, “Cheetos, Fritos, and Doritios!” It wasn’t the glowing gold star that I was looking for, but with no alternative, I took the job.",0
What was your experience like when you first started working in Silicon Valley?,"I did not make it as far as I’d hoped.

We were young; we were educated; we were mostly white, mostly male, and mostly free of student debt. We preferred to wear jeans, drink IPAs, and talk about things—technology trends, SF housing policy, bourbon—as if we knew more about them than we did. Though it would take some time for me to be fully manufactured into a tech bro—for example, I still wore The North Face rather than Patagonia, SF’s preferred corporate athleisure—I was grade A raw material.I was also primed for indoctrination in a more important way: I was ambitious. Despite the Bay Area’s cultural and natural richness, I, like most people flooding into San Francisco’s central neighborhoods, didn’t come for those things. I came for my career. I came to succeed. I came to “have an impact.”  At what or on what, I didn’t know. But in a city overflowing with achievement, I assumed I’d figure it out.",1

I came to “have an impact.”  At what or on what, I didn’t know. But in a city overflowing with achievement, I assumed I’d figure it out.Within a few weeks of being in San Francisco, I hadn’t figured out what it meant to be successful in tech—I’d been run over by it. The three most common things I learned about my new coworkers were their name, their job title, and how early they joined the company. Days after I started, we celebrated raising nearly $100 million in funding—until, a few weeks later, Facebook bought Instagram , a company half our age and a fifth our size, for $1 billion. We lionized coworkers who left to join smaller companies or start their own; we wrote off coworkers who left for established giants like Google or Amazon, as if they were retiring. 8That was the only ruler by which we measured ourselves in San Francisco: How much money had your employer raised, how much hype did it have, and how early did you join? This singular scoreboard hung over everything—in every bar, at every Meetup™, inside every Yoga studio and CrossFit gym, on every date. In the tech bubble, there were no alternative measures of success, like there might be more professionally diverse cities. If you were to pick 20 random people out of a bar in New York or San Diego or Memphis, and ask them to sort themselves by social status, they’d probably disagree about the arrangement. How do you compare a dental hygienist to a teacher to a bike shop owner to an accountant? Why would you compare them at all?",1

Why would you compare them at all?But ask 20 people at The Snug on Fillmore Street, and everyone would give the same answer. In fact, you don’t even need to ask—people who work in tech often arrange themselves by their professional strata on their own. In San Francisco, we are our jobs, we keep score, and we all know who’s winning. We have a scale, and we use it.The Bay Area isn’t entirely special in this regard; DC, for example, is also dominated by one industry, and full of young careerists who are hunting the same jobs. But Silicon Valley’s giant social scoreboard has one unique complication: The innate ambition of San Francisco’s startup class is also supercharged by the tech industry’s obsession with “growth.” We don’t value people by where they are. We value them in the same way we value our companies—by how fast they’re rising. Nobody talks about the CEO of a public company that’s growing at ten percent a year, or the Oracle SVP who’d been an SVP for a decade. We talked about the people and companies on the cusp —the rocket ships, the wunderkinds, the new new things .",1

Unlike other prestige professions, the tech industry celebrates those who skip to the front of the line. Startups have no entry level analyst program, no obligatory MBA hiatus, no rotational associate sequence, no residencies, no defined timelines for becoming a partner or managing director. In Silicon Valley, ""paying your dues"" is hearsay. Through the breathless profiles that fill Forbes, VC blogs , and countless 30 Under 30 lists, startup founders are regularly reminded about those who became rich and famous by refusing to be told they weren’t ready.And so, we all chase a definition of success that can only be measured by how much faster we were moving than our peers. Every step we take, every hour of work we put in, feels like an urgent acceleration towards… something. Fueled by our time and other people’s money, we race one another to the horizon.",1

But there are a lot of parallels between her career and my own, and I know that they mattered to me . We both graduated from college the same year. We both worked at NGOs before moving to corporate jobs. Both of us started companies—Korey started Away and I started Mode, which built software for data analysts—in our mid- to late twenties.Moreover, both of us were opportunistic founders. According to one profile of Korey , she didn’t start Away because of any particular passion for luggage; she started it because her friend’s carry-on split open on an international flight. Despite initially being unsure if she wanted to start a business, Korey’s reluctance turned into cheeky ambition. “We weren’t interested in starting a small business,” she told Forbes , “we wanted to truly improve how people travel on a meaningful scale.”",0

I started it because two of my coworkers at Yammer built a popular internal tool , and they inexplicably offered me a seat at their founding table. But once in it, I was in it—trying to reinvent dashboards; writing countless blog posts about dashboards; being called, by the cruelest person on LinkedIn, a leader in the dashboarding space . 9In other words, Korey and I both stumbled into our respective businesses. Neither of us were building something that the world especially needed. And like so many founders and company leaders who get swept up in feverish ambitions and pace of startup life, we didn’t create businesses to manufacture products for customers; not really . We created them to manufacture accomplishment for ourselves. We just wanted to succeed; to win; to outclimb our peers.",1

Sequoia Capital, a premier venture firm, believes that all of their investments should “have a desperate need to win.” In the wake of Kobe Bryant’s death, Marc Andreessen marked the occasion by reminding people that one of Kobe’s most admirable characteristics was his atomic obsession with winning. Others have explicitly drawn parallels between Kobe and successful founders for the same reason.I get why VCs say this stuff. It’s visceral; it’s provocative; it gets the people going. As a lifelong amateur athlete, my YouTube history is littered with Tiger fist pumps , kick-sixes , buzzer beaters and double bangs , 10 bat flips , home run mics , Nike and Under Armour ads, and Minneapolis Miracle remixes . Without a court to compete on, startups became our arena. And we become as monomaniacal about winning our game as athletes and coaches are about winning theirs.",1

People need competition; they need meaning; we cannot just gaze into the abyss of our fleeting existence on a lonely mote of dust floating through an eternal void. We all have religions because we all need religions. If someone finds purpose in building Instagramable totes, that is no more or less cosmically relevant than anything else. And on a more planetary scale, it’s probably not a bad thing for some people to be entrepreneurs for the love of the game —or even, just for the trophies . Suitcases may not be metaphysically material, but a nice one does make flying a little less of a headache . 11Instead, what I think is important to recognize about our motivations is not that they are bad; it is that they are circumstantial .

Still, the moment was striking to me, not in what it was, but in what it was not. For years, you don’t just work somewhere; you are consumed by it.

It simply means that our ambitions are defined by our environment. On short time scales, this is obvious; in the moments that we desperately crave tacos , or a quiet moment to ourselves, or a cold shower, we know that we won’t want them forever. In a couple hours, we’ll be full and repulsed by food ; in a couple days, we'll want to pop out with some friends ; in a couple months, we’ll want a hot shower and cozy blanket.The same is true over longer time scales; it’s just harder to see.

As long as your environment stays the same, so will your ambitions. You’ll value the same things as you did yesterday, care about the opinions of the same people, and chase the same trophies. If you change this context, these things will change too. But that’s the uncomfortable order it has to happen: You won’t want something new until you walk away from the thing you currently want.That’s the real trap of Silicon Valley, and of other prestige industries.

And then, its scale becomes our scale.

However, the Silicon Valley metonym has grown to include venture-backed startups in other major U.S. cities like New York, Boston, Austin, and, for a minute , Miami. Silicon Valley isn’t a place; it’s a mentality .On “work-life balance,” some people take jobs to get rich, because they’re compulsively ambitious, and because they’re hypnotized by the thrill of explosive growth. Some people take jobs to work on interesting problems, to work with supportive teams, and simply to make enough money to have lives outside of their offices.",0
"What are the different motivations people have for taking jobs, and how do companies balance work-life balance with growth ambitions?","On “work-life balance,” some people take jobs to get rich, because they’re compulsively ambitious, and because they’re hypnotized by the thrill of explosive growth. Some people take jobs to work on interesting problems, to work with supportive teams, and simply to make enough money to have lives outside of their offices.A lot of startups try to have it both ways. They try to offer rides on a rocketship while also putting people and culture first. And when the two are at odds, they gaslight employees by camouflaging oppressive hours as “wild and exciting and unexpected and beautiful.” Other industries like finance are at least direct about what they offer: They pay you a lot of money to steamroll you with work. It may be abusive, but it’s transparent.That’s why I think startups should be more explicit about how they make these tradeoffs. It’s fine to chase growth at all costs, to build a company and culture that prioritizes the lifestyle of its employees first, or to do something in the middle.

We don’t have to define winning around money or market dominance. We can also define it through how much we enjoy the responsibilities that fill our days, or how we support the lives of those we employ. We can still be competitive; we can still have a desperate need to win; we can still refuse to process failure . We just have to be independently-minded enough to not let others define what winning and losing means.Similarly, VCs’ livelihoods—or at least their statuses, their Twitter audiences, their invites to the All-In Summit, and their futures as authors of pop management books with glowing introductions from authors of other pop management books—depend on their portfolios surviving.",0

why do people seek fame and recognition,"It sees no distinction in adding story to story, upon the monuments of fame, erected to the memory of others. It denies that it is glory enough to serve under any chief. It scorns to tread in the footsteps of any predecessor, however illustrious.No doubt, society benefits from some degree of gamified entrepreneurship. But there can be a point at which that goes too far, and rather than working together, every great creator wants their own solo career.For example, there are legions of Zoomers who are obsessed with their social standing on Instagram and TikTok. Do you care about what these people think? Does their game matter ? If that totem pole isn’t important, isn’t it possible to imagine that one day yours may not be either?",0
why do SaaS companies prefer long-term contracts over short-term ones,"I sometimes wonder if companies that buy software would be better off signing ten-year contracts rather than one-year contracts.Typically, it’s buyers who want to sign short-term deals and sellers who want long-term ones. Go to almost any pricing page for a modern SaaS company, and you'll see two prices : 1 A big, bold one, which you'll pay if you're billed annually, and a small, higher one, which you'll pay if you're billed monthly. 2 And if you talk to any software vendor about signing an annual contract, they'll probably give a third option for a multi-year deal, which will have the lowest price of the three.The logic behind this sort of discounting is straightforward. For SaaS vendors, cash commitments are king. The entire business model is built around customers staying customers for a while and, to a lesser degree, up-front payments . Long-term deals offer both of these things. 3 Moreover, in some sense, annual contracts are less work to maintain than monthly ones. If a company knows that a customer will be a customer for the next year, they don’t have to renew that customer’s business every month. For all these reasons, getting 10,000 dollars today is better than probably getting 1,000 dollars a month for the next 12 months, and SaaS companies often offer people that deal.",1

Buyers don’t want commitment; they want flexibility. What if they discover some hidden flaw in the product they bought? What if something about their business changes, and they no longer want to use it? What if a competitor launches a shiny new thing that they really like ? If they’re on a month-to-month contract, they can simply walk away. But if they’re on a long-term contract, they can’t. They can’t credibly demand that the vendor fix whatever thing they don’t like, “or else.” They can stop using the product, but they can’t stop paying for it . They’re locked in.And so, people say , when possible, avoid it . Avoid long-term contracts. Month-to-month is better than an annual commitment; annual is better than multi-year; literally anything is better than ten years.",0

what are some key lessons to keep in mind when choosing technology tools for your business?,"So, to summarize, there are two pieces of learned wisdom about technology and skills:Don't get locked in to one vendor or tool, because you might want to use a different one later.Don’t worry too much about tools, because they aren’t the real solutions to your problems.",0
What is the best approach to selecting and committing to business tools and technologies?,"Don’t worry too much about tools, because they aren’t the real solutions to your problems.But you see the contradiction? The first piece of advice says to maintain optionality—but the second says that the options you’re protecting are what colors to paint your bike shed. The first point implicitly encourages us to always be optimizing our tooling; the second point says do not get distracted by optimizing your tooling.However, if the second point is the more important one—which I think it is—there’s an easy way to be good at it: Do the opposite of the first point. Choose lock-in. Buy the BI tool; burn the boats behind you ; set your tools in stone. Force yourself to worry about people and process problems by taking away your other temptations.",1
why is it important to commit to a single software tool,"However, if the second point is the more important one—which I think it is—there’s an easy way to be good at it: Do the opposite of the first point. Choose lock-in. Buy the BI tool; burn the boats behind you ; set your tools in stone. Force yourself to worry about people and process problems by taking away your other temptations.If you’re in the market for some software product and you whittle your options down to a handful of reasonable finalists, all of those tools are probably good enough. Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, Synapse—does it really matter which you choose? Will “business outcomes” be materially different because the data team chooses a BI tool that its users give 4.60 stars versus 4.58 ? Or 4.58 versus 4.56 ? 4 How much are those 0.02 stars worth? Are they worth anything at all? Because the ability to move between those products, and upgrade from a 4.56 to a 4.60, is the optionality we’re paying for, in both foregone discounts and in the time we lose to distracting debates and product evaluations.It’s worse than that though, because optionality has an even bigger cost: Stability. If you invest in a single tool, you can probably wring more value out of it than you can by constantly trying to find something that’s marginally better. But people are unlikely to make that investment if they’re always window shopping for an upgrade.",0

If you invest in a single tool, you can probably wring more value out of it than you can by constantly trying to find something that’s marginally better. But people are unlikely to make that investment if they’re always window shopping for an upgrade.Imagine a luxury apartment that’s leased by two people who are only committed to it until a better place comes on the market, and only committed to each other until they move. Now imagine a more pedestrian condo that a married couple owns. Which space is better? Imagine a college basketball team of one-and-done freshmen who will be NBA lottery picks. Now imagine one full of future insurance salesmen who’ve been playing together for several years . Which team is better ?In both cases, the stability of the latter option is at least arguably better than the talent of the former. And these are extreme cases, of college teams full of 1- and 2-star recruits versus 4- and 5-star recruits. When we buy software, we often sacrifice that stability, so that we can upgrade from a 4.56 star recruit to a 4.6 star recruit.",1
why is it important to have long-term relationships with software suppliers,"In both cases, the stability of the latter option is at least arguably better than the talent of the former.

When we buy software, we often sacrifice that stability, so that we can upgrade from a 4.56 star recruit to a 4.6 star recruit.There are business examples too. In his 14 key principles for management , W. Edwards Deming recommends that companies “move toward a single supplier for any one item, on a long-term relationship of loyalty and trust.” This is important, Deming says, because quality requires consistency . Multiple suppliers create variability and inconsistency; variable and inconsistent businesses struggle to improve. The same principle likely applies for having multiple software “suppliers.” Migrating between tools—or even just questioning if a tool is right, and always evaluating new ones—is a lot more disruptive than making the most out of something that might be missing a few of the latest features.The two main arguments against these sorts of long-term deals are, one, products can stagnate, and two, vendors can exploit long-term customers because they don’t need to earn their business anymore.",0
what are the pros and cons of long-term vendor contracts,"The two main arguments against these sorts of long-term deals are, one, products can stagnate, and two, vendors can exploit long-term customers because they don’t need to earn their business anymore.Though the first risk is real, it happens more slowly than most people imagine. Microstrategy, a 35-year old BI tool, has a rating of 4.4 stars . 5 Barring some extreme event, like a business collapse or a broken acquisition, most products don’t die overnight.The second risk actually seems backwards. Like Deming suggests, loyal long-term customers have more influence over their suppliers than fickle ones. Google may not need to win Snapchat’s business every year anymore, but Google really needs to win it every five years. As anyone who’s ever sold software before will tell you, it’s not the aggressive negotiators that keep you awake at night; it’s long-term customers who are gradually getting unhappy.

The theory sounds nice—a bunch of specialized Lego pieces, assembled together to meet exact needs of every customer, working in tightly integrated harmony around standard protocols and languages—but the reality is it’s too many options :The economics never worked and the experience was dysfunctional .

How is AI transforming the advertising industry?,"We may be getting there.

Brands can choose from an array of stock avatars “created from video footage of real paid actors that are licensed for commercial use,” or they can opt for a customizable avatar that could be designed to look like a specific creator.Right now, TikTok is only using generative AI to help advertisers create ads before they serve them.

what measures should companies take to ensure cybersecurity and protect customer data,"Snowflake, as part of their commitment to transparency , hired third-party cybersecurity experts CrowdStrike and Mandiant to investigate the hack; they “have not identified evidence suggesting this activity was caused by a vulnerability, misconfiguration, or breach of Snowflake’s platform” or “by compromised credentials of current or former Snowflake personnel;” they said it was caused “ compromised customer credentials ” that were “exposed through unrelated cyber threat activity;” they strongly recommend that all account administrators use multi-factor authentication to protect their accounts.In other words, Snowflake says that they did what any reasonable cloud software vendor would be expected to do. And while it is unfortunate that this happened, the important thing to know is that it wasn’t their fault.—",0
who is responsible when a data breach occurs,"—But was it? Was Snowflake to blame? Their customers? Nobody but the hackers themselves? What exactly are we supposed to make of this whole thing? 3On one hand, by all accounts, it doesn’t seem like Snowflake did anything capital-W Wrong. They followed the protocols that they were supposed to follow; they built software according to the standards they were supposed to meet; no Snowflake employee stole anything, left a door open, or told somebody something they shouldn’t have. 4 They were an ATM, and someone stole their customers’ PINs. It is hard to blame the ATM for that.",0
what are the security challenges associated with cloud-based data warehouses like Snowflake,"On one hand, by all accounts, it doesn’t seem like Snowflake did anything capital-W Wrong. They followed the protocols that they were supposed to follow; they built software according to the standards they were supposed to meet; no Snowflake employee stole anything, left a door open, or told somebody something they shouldn’t have. 4 They were an ATM, and someone stole their customers’ PINs. It is hard to blame the ATM for that.On the other hand, Snowflake did, in a sense, make the ATM popular. Twenty years ago, most databases lived behind firewalls and were only available via VPNs or from approved IP addresses. Corporate data was, almost literally, in a locked vault that you had to physically break into to steal. Today, in part because of Snowflake’s success and its own efforts marketing the benefits of the cloud , people can log into their databases like they would any other website, through a publicly-accessible web page , 5 with a username and password. Snowflake also helped popularize using basic authentication methods like usernames and passwords as the modern standard by which data products connect to databases .In essence, Snowflake and other cloud warehouse vendors moved data out of the firewalled vaults, and into ATMs all over the internet. That’s a design pattern that is fundamentally more vulnerable to certain types of hacks than the prior version. 6 Accordingly, most criticisms of Snowflake aren’t just about Snowflake, but about problems inherent in SaaS software: That simple single-factor authentication is simple to hack. When money is in a bank, you have to rob the bank to get it out. When money is an ATM, you just need to steal some debit cards and phish for people’s PINs. 7",1

When money is in a bank, you have to rob the bank to get it out. When money is an ATM, you just need to steal some debit cards and phish for people’s PINs. 7But! It’s also a design pattern that we like! ATMs are convenient. Multi-factor authentication is annoying . The convenience of the cloud and putting everything on the internet is the world we asked for—and so, it’s a world that Snowflake can give us, without violating any generally accepted accessibility protocols. In 2000, had a company built a database that you could log into from a website and with the password “ password ,” we would probably blame that company if its customers’ accounts got hacked. Now, eh—we may not exonerate the company completely, but we put a lot of the blame on the customers themselves.That’s the thing about data breaches, and about the entire software security industrial complex: It’s not about security; it’s about blame .",0
why do companies focus on compliance rather than actual security,"That’s the thing about data breaches, and about the entire software security industrial complex: It’s not about security; it’s about blame .Most companies don’t get have lengthy security pages and pay for tedious compliance reports because they believe that jumping through a bunch of bureaucratic hoops, like logging when every employee was added or removed from Asana, will make anything meaningfully more secure; they jump through those hoops and get those reports so that, if something does go wrong, they can say that it’s not their fault. 8 The probability that companies want to minimize is not the probability of a hack; they want to minimize the probability that they get blamed for a hack . 9 Compliance standards aren’t about security; compliance standards are about liability. 10 And in the two-decade long transition to the cloud, we’ve come to shift the liability for things like bad password policies onto the users and not the vendors.That’s the bet Snowflake made in making things like multi-factor authentication optional—that they ultimately wouldn’t be blamed for a hack like this. As the story escalated, 11 they’ve added the reverse Streisand : Turn a mountain into a molehill by largely doing as little press as possible , 12 and hope the whole thing blows over. Which probably isn’t a bad strategy, at least for the time being. If the important thing is for people not to think that it’s your fault—and in cloud software security, that is and always has been the important thing—you can’t get blamed for something that nobody’s talking about.",1

The entire corporate cybersecurity apparatus is designed to preemptively make the case that whatever went wrong isn’t our fault. But we don’t just do that with security policies. We pre-build this argument—that the important thing for you to know is that it’s not my fault—all the time, and are as frequently motivated by it as we are whatever problem we’re ostensibly trying to solve.For example, when a controversial decision is being made, people will often softly object. They won’t want to change the decision, because then, if something bad happens, it will be their fault. Instead, they will just want to object “for the record”—a record that will likely get forgotten if things go well, but they’ll definitely remember if things go poorly.",0
why do people avoid taking full responsibility for decisions,"For example, when a controversial decision is being made, people will often softly object. They won’t want to change the decision, because then, if something bad happens, it will be their fault. Instead, they will just want to object “for the record”—a record that will likely get forgotten if things go well, but they’ll definitely remember if things go poorly.For example, when an investor invests in a startup, they will sometimes push CEOs to make certain decisions. They will nudge, cajole, and coerce—but almost never outright instruct. Because they aren’t here to make decisions; they’re here to advise and support. If that advice works out, great, they’re adding value. And if it doesn’t, well, that’s not their fault. The CEO makes the decisions.For example, when an executive asks a data team for some sort of analysis, they’re asking for counsel, but they’re also often asking for a contingency. If the decision goes well , “you can claim credit for your cleverness. If it doesn’t, you can say you just did what any reasonable person would’ve done,” and listened to the data.

how do tech companies handle data security,"When stories like the one about Snowflake come out, the first reaction is usually to point fingers. The second is bewilderment: How could they let this happen? How could they have been so unusually careless?Which, oh man, if only. Every tech company presents themselves like Initech, as very serious experts who build bleeding-edge security programs with militaristic discipline. And maybe a few do. But most tech companies are FTX : Full of loose access controls, everything passed around Slack, held together by Scotch tape and bubble gum .Back sometime before the pandemic, the team at Mode used a popular product—let's call it PodesData —that connected directly to Snowflake, which we were using as our primary data warehouse. PodesData had to interact with our data, and was was authorized to do it in the same way as just about every other tool that connects to Snowflake: We created a new Snowflake user called something like THIRD_PARTY_PODESDATA, granted that user access to the data is that PodesData needed to see, and provided that users’s password to PodesData, via some web form inside of their application.",0

We emailed their support team, and an agent started investigating different things that might’ve gone wrong.

Because the existence of this screenshot meant three things:The support agent had logged into the Snowflake app with the username and password we gave PodesData.

Our ticket hadn’t been escalated to PodesData’s senior staff; the problem wasn’t urgent. This practice, of copying plaintext passwords, logging into customer accounts, and looking at whatever data they deemed useful, wasn’t an exception in an emergency. It was, by all appearances, standard procedure.We threw a tantrum, canceled our contract on the spot, and migrated to a competitor within a few days.

This year, Databricks bought Tabular , which is a piece of database middleware that was attempting to turn an open-source data format into a product, for between one and two billion dollars .Neither deals were traditional nine-figure tech acquisitions, in which an acquirer is looking to buy a mature product, customers, and a revenue stream. Instead, they were both about hiring teams. In MosaicML, Databricks bought a bunch of experienced AI researchers (and some GPUs) in a bet that every enterprise will eventually want to train their own LLM .

how has Silicon Valley culture changed over the years,"In 2012, it was a party. When I moved to Silicon Valley that year, it was no longer a place for nerdy rebels or idealistic misfits, but a place to get rich without feeling guilty about it. After the financial crisis, a generation of country club brats had started questioning if working at McKinsey really was the most prestigious thing that they could do after graduating from Duke, and tech offered a promising alternative. The Nasdaq was on a steady march upwards from its lows in 2009; huge tech IPOs were back ; huge tech acquisitions were back ; Google paid as well as Morgan Stanley, gave you unlimited time off, and didn’t make you work until 8 p.m. if you wanted to eat dinner for free . Back then, you could have it all: Money and status and time off, without being evil , without tucking your shirt in, and without having to leave the office for a couple (dozen) beers.Of course, the whole thing had an ugly underbelly—but the perpetrators of that era’s corporate culture weren't worried about that yet. The prevailing sentiment in most tech offices was optimism. 1 And not for some promising future that we were building, but for the present. It didn’t matter that the old cliché about tech making the world a better place was already a joke , because for much of Silicon Valley, the world was a pretty good place as it was.In 2014, the frat house got raided.

Fifty percent of the startups in Y Combinator are building around it. Eighty-five percent of tech companies in the S&P 500 are talking about it. Companies are rebranding themselves around it. Snowflake is no longer a database, or The Data Cloud, but the AI Data Cloud™. Asana is the “#1 AI work management platform.” 6 Intercom is AI-first . No, Zendesk is AI-first . 7 We are impaneling conferences about AI; raising venture funds ; 8 starting newsletters; hosting emergency podcasts. This is not an iPhone moment or the next internet , because those things had naysayers . Now, the only debate seems to be about which side of the AI revolution human beings will be on .It’s the crypto gold rush all over again, except the winners are paid in legal tender . It’s the crypto gold rush, except the losers won’t just miss out on some money; they’ll get steamrolled into obsolescence.

If you don’t put out a song, people— including the person you’re battling —might call you a coward. This is bad in a rap battle. You cannot win a rap battle without battling in it. 9But putting out a song is risky. If people like the song, they’ll make memes about it and you will score a lot of points. This will be good for you and bad for your opponent. If people don’t like the song, however, people will also make memes about it—but they will be bad for you and good for your opponent. Hence the choice, about what to do, if you are in a rap battle: Don’t drop a song and take a guaranteed small loss, or do drop and wait for the internet to decide if you put out a banger or a bomb.Ideally, you wouldn’t have to make this choice. Your best option is option three: Record the song and figure out if people like it before you drop it. Unfortunately, as a famous rapper, you can’t do this.

how does dbt work in data modeling?,"One way to think about a dbt model is that it’s a table. It’s easy to think this, because most dbt models do, literally, create tables in a database. A company might have a products table that’s imported from their inventory management system, a charges table that’s imported from their Stripe account, and a dbt model called orders that combines the two into a table that contains details about anything anyone ever bought from the company. That dbt model will be a SQL query; the output of the SQL query will be a table.But another way to think about a dbt model is that it’s a function . The data team is trying to create something—in this case, a list of everything the company has ever sold—and the orders model takes two tables as inputs and produces a new table as its output. The model is a formula that contains a bunch of computational logic that describes how to do that calculation.A dbt project, then, is roughly analogous to a program. Each model is a function. The functions can reference one another. And the functions’ authors layer them on top of each other, with the goal of producing a collection of tables 1 that people can use to build dashboards and answer questions.",

And the functions’ authors layer them on top of each other, with the goal of producing a collection of tables 1 that people can use to build dashboards and answer questions.Of course, dbt Labs didn’t invent this sort of data modeling “program.” Prior to dbt, data teams used other tools to manufacture the datasets that people used to build reports and do analysis. But, the previous versions of these programs were hard to write. They were written in languages that are less accessible than SQL; they ran against databases that were relatively slow and relatively easy to break; the production datasets were sometimes complex and confusing objects like OLAP cubes. To create the orders tables in an Oracle Database 10 g in 2004, you had to design a table was legible to Oracle’s BI tool, write your own CREATE statements that produce that table, hand-code things like transaction blocks to make sure your script doesn’t nuke the entire database or send it spiraling into some infinite loop , index your new table correctly, figure out somewhere to deploy the script, and then monitor the whole thing to make sure that a missing shrink operation doesn’t grind your 10 g into useless brick. And if you had lots of models that used your orders table as an input, you had to figure out how to make sure they always run at the right times, in the right order.It was hard. It took time to learn how to do it. One does not simply walk into orders tables; they take the Oracle 2 Day DBA course first.",
how has the process of data modeling evolved over time?,"It was hard. It took time to learn how to do it. One does not simply walk into orders tables; they take the Oracle 2 Day DBA course first.The people who took those sorts of courses, however, didn’t just learn technical skills. They also learned about the art of data modeling. They learned how to organize and arrange the various functions in their “program” so that they’d be easy to update. They learned how to design efficient functions that wouldn’t crash the database. They learned how to structure the final datasets that they produced so that they would be easy to use. It wasn’t perfect, by any means, but there was a sense of rigor to the entire exercise. People wrote “ definitive guides ” about it.dbt changed all this—mostly for the better, but a bit for the worse. People could construct data models in pure SQL; they didn’t need to worry about things like transaction blocks or table indexes or DDL; dbt handled the dependency graph between models and made sure everything always ran in order. Moreover, modern databases made everything much more durable—whereas an inefficient model might knock down an old Teradata warehouse or Hadoop cluster, products like Redshift and Snowflake could absorb it.",

Three weeks ago, as part of their Spring 2024 Product Launch , Sigma—a cloud analytics platform that uses a familiar spreadsheet interface to give business users instant access to explore and get insights from their cloud data warehouse—released a ""collaborative environment that makes advanced data science approachable to the business with Python support and a refined SQL experience."" Two days ago, as part of their 2024 Spring Release , Hex—a collaborative environment for advanced data analysis that combines Python support and a refined SQL experience —released a spreadsheet interface and no-code data browsing, which “opens up Hex to a whole new universe of people"" by giving business users instant access to explore and get insights from their cloud data warehouse.",
why do companies in the tech industry often end up looking similar to each other over time?,"We talked last week about Equals, the cloud spreadsheet app that now supports writing SQL. Well.

We have a special collection of features; a new idea; hope. But customer by customer, contract by negotiated contract, we auction ourselves off to the highest bidder. We amputate our extremities first—a small compromise, here and there, for the greater good. Is it not worth selling a kidney to keep ourselves alive? The money is merely a means to advance the mission.But then we replace a limb, or two, until we finally come for the heart—spreadsheets for notebooks; notebooks for spreadsheets; SQL for analysts; drag-and-drop data visualizations for everyone; whatever you need, just sign the contract. Our bodies, Theseused ; our souls, bankrupted, gradually, then suddenly , when we reanimate ourselves under some tagline—the complete cloud solution for business analytics; human-powered AI; the enterprise intelligence suite—as hideously conjoined as the Frankenstein that lurches out of our development laboratory and into some astroturfed Product Hunt post.

There were so many companies ; so many ideas; so many possible revolutions and reinventions. Surely some revelation was at hand. But no. You can outrun death, but you cannot outrun the devil. The beast approaches , and stalking us into oblivion . We stay different and die, or we survive, dissected and recomposed into an integrated end-to-end analytics workflow.There was also an addendum to Hex’s fundraising announcement: They raised more money from Snowflake Ventures.

why is Snowflake investing in other BI tools,"There was also an addendum to Hex’s fundraising announcement: They raised more money from Snowflake Ventures. Two weeks before that, Sigma announced the same thing . And sandwiched in between the two, Omni, yet another BI tool, said that they also raised money from Snowflake Ventures.Sigma and Hex were both already in Snowflake’s portfolio, and the latest investment in Hex wasn’t (at least publicly) part of a bigger round led by other investors. So these deals aren’t about incubating an ecosystem of promising startups, but, it seems, about Snowflake buying their way onto bigger partners’ roadmaps and boxing out competitors from doing the same. I’ve said before that consolidation doesn’t have to come from outright acquisitions, 8 but can come from quid pro quo alliances . That seems like Snowflake’s approach here: In exchange for money and the Snowflake sales team selling Hex and Sigma, the two companies will prioritize building a Snowflake Native App over a Databricks Lakehouse App , or integrate more directly with Snowpark Container Services , or won’t build anything that might dramatically lower how much a customer uses Snowflake. There’s a lot of value as being seen as star around which everyone else resolves, and Snowflake appears intent on keeping other companies in their orbit.Or who knows, maybe now is just a really good time to invest in software .",
how do you differentiate between simple and easy,"Or who knows, maybe now is just a really good time to invest in software .And now, a queryable semantic layer .From Rich Hickey’s famous talk on this subject , simple means the opposite of complex. A straight line is simple; a cursive H is complex. These are objective descriptions. Easy things, by contrast, are near to our abilities. For John Hancock , writing a cursive H was probably easy. It’s a relative description: What is easy for one person might be difficult for another.",

Being aware of when a customer submitted a feature request or had a technical issue helped CSMs do both.Photography is a useful analogy here. Back in the day of analog film, people who took a lot of pictures tended to also learn more about the craft of photography. They didn’t have to—the only actual barrier to taking pictures was knowing how to work the camera—but the two got bound together. Why go to the effort of teaching yourself how to use a complex camera and spend money on expensive film if you were going to take bad pictures with it?",
how has digital photography changed the way people approach taking pictures?,"Photography is a useful analogy here. Back in the day of analog film, people who took a lot of pictures tended to also learn more about the craft of photography. They didn’t have to—the only actual barrier to taking pictures was knowing how to work the camera—but the two got bound together. Why go to the effort of teaching yourself how to use a complex camera and spend money on expensive film if you were going to take bad pictures with it?Now, the technical parts of photography are much simpler. “Film” is effectively free. That makes photography much more forgiving, but it also means that a lot of people who don’t know anything about how to take good pictures are going to start taking a lot more of them.I mean, it’s right there .",
how should we measure the success of dbt projects,"I mean, it’s right there .dbt’s newer competitors don’t solve this problem either. SQLMesh, for example, is mostly dbt with better developer ergonomics. That’s useful, and might sell well—we all like ergonomic things—but it sidesteps the core issue: How do we become good designers of the thing we’re building?People, including dbt, tend to measure dbt projects by how many models they have. Which I get; models are the most prominent object in dbt, and are an obvious thing to count. However, that frames dbt in the wrong way. By emphasizing models, we implicitly define dbt as a tool for creating tables. I think it’s more useful to frame dbt as program to create data assets, and dbt models as functions—and we would never count the number of functions in programs. But if we measure in tables, we think in tables.",
