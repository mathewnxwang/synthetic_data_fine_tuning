        "input": "describe one of Mode's fundraising decks",
        "output": "Almost ten years ago, we made this slide for one of our fundraising decks. I thought that this slide said that Mode, which we primarily designed for analysts and other ambiguous data professionals, was a product built for a huge, $16 billion market. I thought it said that even that figure understated our eventual potential, because, once we entered our more sinister second phase—selling to the enterprise, obviously—we would be a company with $60 billion of economic opportunity. I thought that this slide told investors that we had done our research: We weren’t quixotic dreamers who had become enamored with our own toys and were tilting at technological windmills; we were shrewd capitalists who had been inspired by a hopeful vision for a better future, and by the tables in the appendix of the International Data Corporation’s Worldwide Semiannual Big Data and Analytics Software Tracker®. I thought it said that we had read the canon, and knew that markets were the most important determinant of a startup’s success. Though I knew the numbers were rough, I thought that this slide said that we were a serious business with serious ambitions to sell to serious customers. In hindsight, I suspect that it said nothing of the sort. And what it said instead—which was a lot—wasn’t particularly good: The slide said that we don't know who our product was for, or who we wanted to sell to. “Analysts and data scientists” is a notoriously vague set of buyers, and “knowledge workers” is even worse. If that was the best definition we could come up with for our market, it said that we hadn’t done the work to understand who might buy what we were building—or worse still, we didn’t even know who wanted to build something for. It said we were planning on casting a uselessly wide and prohibitively expensive net to find customers, that we’d probably end up making a product for a bunch of loosely related but ultimately disjointed buyers, and that our product would eventually get drawn and quartered by a user base that would pull us in a dozen different directions."

        "input": "what does it mean to be an ambitious company",
        "output": "The most ambitious companies are those that redefine old market boundaries. If we wanted to tell a story about our ambition, showing the size of the current market is just the first chapter. We should’ve also talked about how we expected the market to change, and how we would nudge it along that evolutionary path. That’s the space that the most ambitious companies fill: They don’t have to be category creators in a traditional sense, but they often expand or blur the lines around existing paradigms. Notion, for example, didn’t really create a new category, but blended together parts of Google Docs, to-do lists, internal documentation software, and static website builders. Redshift wasn’t a new category—like Snowflake, it started as a simple database that was uniquely fast and cheap and easy to manage—but made analytical databases accessible to companies that couldn’t afford or maintain older generations of products. In cases like these, market maps and Gartner forecasts are the setup. The punchline is how they’re going to change."

        "input": "how to create a pitch deck for VCs",
        "output": "We Googled how to make a pitch deck, found the same Sequoia template that everyone finds, made a slide called “Market Opportunity” that said something about TAMs and SAMs and SOMs and CAGR, and threw as gaudy of a number on it as we could muster."

        "input": "how should a pitch deck be structured",
        "output": "Pitch decks, one might argue, should follow a numbingly predictable structure—a problem slide with bewildered customers, this market sizing slide, two-by-two grids, “a world class team of builders” with little logos of their previous companies under each headshot—for the same reasons resumes should be full of bot-baiting buzzwords: It helps the automatons who read them—VCs, overworked recruiters, and the 24-year olds who are working as frontline filters for both, Tinder-swiping through resumes and decks while watching YouTube in the background—quickly scan each document in 2.3 minutes."

        "input": "how do startups fail",
        "output": "They plan to make something that people want, build an incomplete version of it in two years, not many people want that thing, and then they run out of money groping around their huge hypothetical TAM for the handful of people who are willing to buy their barren and buggy prototype. But better to know that—and to make a different plan—than to bank on the fantasy of starting with “data workers” and moving to “all workers.”"

    {
        "input": "how to think about market sizing",
        "output": "Market sizing is the same exercise, more or less. It can be useless, if you treat it as a mechanical assignment to find a big number in a Forrester report, say “we can sell to five percent of this,” and feel good about your eventual potential. Or it can be helpful, if you use it as a way to figure out—and more importantly, define, for the sake of your own focus—the very narrow market you’ll actually sell to first. That’s the only two-step plan that works: Start with some painfully small set of buyers—data teams of a particular type, college students at Ivy League schools, cheap startups who need video conferencing with screen sharing—and expand into the same market but with fewer qualifiers. And market sizing slides should explain that strategy. "

        "input": "what is linkedin",
        "output": "Ten years ago, LinkedIn, which was bought by Microsoft in 2016, was a résumé and a rolodex.2 It was a career fair for tryhards, a website that you never logged into unless you were either looking for a job, looking to fill a job, or looking up how old someone was.3 Now, it’s a true social network, for work. There are feeds; there are posts; there are likes and followers and influencers. And while Microsoft shares very little about how many people use LinkedIn, it seems to be having a prolonged moment of popularity. It’s no longer a passive professional portfolio that gets updated once every few years, but a place where people post regularly, and a website—and app!—that we idly scroll through like we used to scroll through Facebook 15 years ago."

        "input": "how to use linkedin",
        "output": "LinkedIn is for…advertising our work? It’s our work lives, oversaturated in Lo-Fi. Nearly everything on LinkedIn is either a press release or a corporate blog post for our personal brand: “Official” announcements of job changes; sharing “major news” about our employers’ moves eight pixels to the northeast, and across some contrived equator, on the Gartner Magic Quadrant; AI-authored appreciation posts for the hardworking team that hosted a webinar; 300-word algorithmically-optimized stories about the best advice we ever got, or a recent moment of gratitude, or some other answer to the question, “What is your biggest weakness?” "

        "input": "why does using linkedin feel so weird",
        "output": "Unlike other social media networks, nothing on LinkedIn is spontaneous. No post is just a thought, or the beginning of a genuine discussion. Instead, everything feels planned and scheduled; every interaction is something between politely professional and suspiciously enthusiastic; every message is awkwardly formatted to be maximally viral. The only two emotions on LinkedIn are bittersweet endings and very exciting beginnings. It’s not socializing; it’s editorial calendar crosstalk. What’s even weirder, however, is how isolated LinkedIn is. It’s a vault, locked on both sides. If something blows up on Twitter or TikTok, it crosses over into group chats, into other social networks, into the New York Times, on to TV, and into conversations at parties and in people’s homes. Twitter isn’t real life, as they say, but the two are definitely intertwined."

    {
        "input": "why do people use linkedin",
        "output": "I can’t help but wonder if that’s also part of the attraction of LinkedIn: It’s a social network where we can all feel popular, even in our khakis and corporate drawl. It’s a perpetual online work trip, where everyone feels professionally obligated to act like friends. Over the last twenty years, we’ve all become addicted to our jobs and to checking our email. Our lives have moved online. We slowly erased our personalities and replaced them with our professional brands. We lost our friends to our phones, and we are lonely. For some people, Twitter and other online communities can fill that void. But it’s hard to get popular on Twitter or Instagram—you have to be clever, funny, and engage in the political and social drama that a lot of people seem to either want to avoid, or have no knack for. LinkedIn offers us a deal: Don’t really be yourself; don’t talk about taboo things; put up a professional headshot; feign excitement about your new role managing enterprise IoT applications on the edge.11 Do all that, and LinkedIn will reward you with likes and digital hugs, with messages and DMs, and with a stream of notifications that make you feel connected and important. Sure, the friends you make might be superficial; they might be there to sell you stuff,12 or to “expand their network,” or because they’re community advocates and paid evangelists for a company that’s identified you as a likely buyer. And their likes and comments might be nudges to draw attention to themselves. But a like is still a like; people are viewing your profile; when you talk, something talks back. The conversation is real, even if the motivations are more suspect.13 And as dozens of AI-friend apps are proving, that’s worth something. Offer up your personality and a few self-promotional posts, and LinkedIn will make you feel like a celebrity. It will turn you Truman Burbank—except Truman got to be himself. In this social network, you have to be an actor too."
